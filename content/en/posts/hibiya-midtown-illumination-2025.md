The 2025 Hibiya Midtown Illumination has become even more spectacular with Disney's 'Zootopia 2' collaboration.

The **6th floor Park View Garden** with its stunning **Hibiya Park view** is an absolute must-visit spot.

We'll introduce the perfect route where you can enjoy the walking course connecting to Marunouchi Illumination, and even explore Hibiya Park's autumn foliage during the day.

## 💡 Recommended! How to Enjoy Hibiya 200% (Day + Night)

Midtown Hibiya has an excellent location that connects very well with other attractions.

This is a course where you can combine Hibiya Illumination, Hibiya Midtown Christmas, and Hibiya Park autumn foliage all at once.

We suggest two best courses.

### 1. 🌇 'Autumn Foliage + Illumination' Course Starting from Daytime

If you arrive at Hibiya during the day, be sure to visit **Hibiya Park** right next door.

From mid-November to early December, Hibiya Park's autumn foliage is at its peak. This course allows you to enjoy autumn foliage in the park during the day, have a meal or tea at Hibiya Midtown, and then watch the illumination at lighting time.

</figure>

### 2. 🚶‍♂️ Evening 'Marunouchi → Hibiya' Walking Course

Tokyo Station's **Marunouchi Illumination** and **Hibiya Illumination** are essentially connected.

Starting from Tokyo Station and walking through the chandelier lights of the luxury street (Marunouchi Nakadori), you'll naturally arrive at Midtown Hibiya. (About 10-15 minutes walk)

This is the best walking course where you can see two major illuminations at once.

### 1️⃣ HIBIYA Magic Time SQUARE (Zootopia 2)

This is the main space.

The main tree, approximately 8m tall (larger than last year), will be installed.

The lighting is inspired by the worldview of 'Zootopia 2'.

Combined with the surrounding cube-shaped lights, it provides a dynamic and spectacular experience.

- Theme: Disney 'Zootopia 2'
- Period: November 13, 2025 ~ December 25 (until Christmas)

### 2️⃣ (Photo Zone) ETERNAL HEART TREE

This is a photo zone debuting this year.

A 'katsura tree' decorated with dazzling silver-white lights.

On the tree, a single red heart ❤️ ornament sparkles like a heartbeat.

True to its name as the 'eternal heart tree', it's a great spot for taking photos with lovers or family.

- Location: Hibiya Step Square (top of stairs)

### 3️⃣ HIBIYA AREA ILLUMINATION (Hibiya Nakadori)

This is the illumination on 'Hibiya Nakadori', the main street in front of Midtown Hibiya.

Here's the important point! The lighting theme changes around Christmas.

You can feel a completely different atmosphere depending on whether you visit before Christmas or at year-end/New Year.

**1) Theme 1: HOT JAZZ**
- **Period: November 13 ~ December 25, 2025**
- Features: Inspired by American jazz from the 1920s-30s. Characterized by energetic and colorful full-color lighting.

</figure>

**2) Theme 2: NOCTURNE**
- **Period: December 26, 2025 ~ February 28, 2026**
- Features: Inspired by the quiet night scenery. Deep blue lighting creates a mysterious and calm atmosphere.

### 4️⃣ PARK VIEW WINTER GARDEN (6th Floor Park View)

This is what I consider the best spot at Hibiya Midtown Illumination.

It's the 6th floor 'Park View Garden'.

Why you must visit here!

**Overwhelming Hibiya Park View**

You can capture **Hibiya Park** shining in the darkness and the **city night view** all at once.

**Official Winter Garden**

The 6th floor lawn square is decorated with 'full-color lighting', and the surrounding plants are adorned with 'white lighting'.

You can enjoy a fantastic 'winter garden' where lights change to music.

  <figcaption style="font-size: 0.7em; text-align: center;">Hibiya Midtown 6th floor Park View Garden illumination</figcaption>
</figure>

♻️ Eco-Friendly Illumination: All lights at Hibiya Midtown use 'green energy' (solar, etc.), and the 6th floor Winter Garden also uses 'plant lights' that generate electricity through the power of plants and microorganisms.

</div>

There are fewer people than the 1st floor square, making it great for leisurely taking photos.

If you visit Hibiya Midtown, be sure to go up to the 6th floor!

## ⚠️ Important! 2025 Hibiya Park Christmas Market?

Many people search for Hibiya Illumination and Hibiya Park Christmas Market together.

Here's really important information!

The 2025 Tokyo Christmas Market is NOT held at Hibiya Park!

Don't go to Hibiya Park just based on reviews from last year or the year before.

**🎁 2025 Tokyo Christmas Market Locations**

- Meiji Jingu Gaien (11/21~12/25)
- Shiba Park (12/5~12/25)

We recommend enjoying the illumination at Midtown Hibiya, and then moving to 'Shiba Park' or 'Meiji Jingu' for the Christmas market.

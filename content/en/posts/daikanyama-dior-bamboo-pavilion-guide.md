## 6. Pre-Visit FAQ: Daikanyama Dior Real-Time Q&A

<p>Here are the most frequently asked questions from visitors planning a trip to the <strong>Daikanyama Dior Bamboo Pavilion</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Q1. Can I book the guided tour or cafe on the same day?</strong></p>
<p>A. Both the guided program and cafe operate on a reservation-only basis. Cafe Dior in particular requires online booking at least 24 hours before your visit, so we recommend securing your spot as soon as your travel dates are confirmed. (Guided tours are available in Japanese and English.)</p>

<p>A. Absolutely. The official website reservation system works with just an email and international phone number — no Japanese phone number required. English pages are supported, making it easy for international travelers to book.</p>

<p><strong>Q3. What about tax-free benefits at Dior Japan?</strong></p>
<p>A. You can receive a 10% consumption tax exemption by presenting your passport. However, some consumable items may be excluded from tax-free eligibility, so we recommend double-checking with staff before payment.</p>

<p><strong>Q4. Is photography allowed inside the store?</strong></p>
<p>A. Yes, photography is permitted. However, since Daikanyama Dior is a shopping boutique rather than a gallery, please be considerate of other customers' shopping experience when taking photos.</p>

<p>The HERMES event at Toranomon Hills was so popular that reservations sold out instantly. I was lucky enough to attend 'MYSTERY AT THE GROOMS' held at TOKYO NODE (Tokyo Node Gallery) on the 45th floor of Toranomon Hills. I'll share my event review, online game tips for those who missed out, and detailed directions to Tokyo Node.</p>

<h2>🐎 Reservation Frenzy! November's Hottest 'HERMES Horse Hunt'</h2>

<p>I attended the most talked-about special exhibition event in Tokyo recently - Toranomon Hills HERMES event.</p>

<p>It's called 'MYSTERY AT THE GROOMS' (Finding HERMES Horses).</p>

<p>As the name suggests, it's not just a simple exhibition but an 'immersive quiz tour' where visitors become HERMES detectives to solve hidden mysteries.</p>

<p>The fun story is based on finding mischievous horses that have hidden themselves among HERMES objects.</p>

<p>Despite being free, the quality was truly befitting of HERMES.</p>

<h2>🕵️‍♂️ 'Finding HERMES Horses' Vivid Experience Review</h2>

<p>Check-in started 15 minutes before the reservation time, and you had to complete check-in by 5 minutes before to enter. (If you're late, you can't enter even with a reservation!)</p>

<p>Upon entry, 'Grooms' (horse caretakers) warmly welcome you and kick off the story.</p>

<p><strong>⭐ Essential Item: Charged Smartphone!</strong></p>
<p>This event required using your personal smartphone to find clues and solve quizzes. Without battery, you essentially couldn't experience it.</p>

<p>The event involved touring 6 different spaces over 70 minutes to complete missions.</p>

<p>The mission was to find 5 'horses' hidden in each space among HERMES products like scarves, bags, ties, and jewelry.</p>

<p>The set quality and creative content were so impressive that it truly felt like "This is HERMES" - hard to believe it was a free event.</p>

<p>It was enjoyable solo, and there were actually many families with children. (However, reservations are only for elementary school age and above)</p>

<h2>🗺️ How to Get to Toranomon Hills TOKYO NODE 45F</h2>

<p>Tokyo Node Gallery is located on the 45th floor of Toranomon Hills Station Tower.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Subway: Directly connected to Tokyo Metro Hibiya Line (H) 'Toranomon Hills Station'</strong></li>
</ul>

</figure>

<p><strong>📍 How to Get to 45F (Important)</strong></p>
<p>If this is your first time, it might be a bit confusing. Here's the easiest route I personally took:</p>

<ol>
  <li>From basement or 1F, take <strong>C elevator or shuttle elevator</strong> to 7F.</li>
  <li>From 7F Sky Lobby, <strong>take escalator to 8F TOKYO NODE entrance</strong>.</li>
  <li>From 8F, transfer to high-rise elevator to go up to 45F.</li>
</ol>

<h2>💻 It's Not Over Yet! Online 'Horse Hunt' Game</h2>

<p>Good news for those who missed the on-site reservation or the event has ended.</p>

<p>You can experience the 'Finding HERMES Horses' game online on the official HERMES website (Hermes.com)!</p>

<p><strong>🐎 HERMES Official Website 'Horse Hunt' Game Link</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.hermes.com/jp/ja/content/mystery-at-the-grooms/" target="_blank">https://www.hermes.com/jp/ja/content/mystery-at-the-grooms/</a></p>

<p>It's a mission to find 5 hidden horses, offering a different kind of fun from the on-site event. Even if you missed the in-person visit, experience HERMES's wit through the online game.</p>

<p>The Toranomon Hills HERMES event is a very special free exhibition available for the short period until November 24th.</p>

<p>Although reservations are difficult with full bookings every day, if you get the chance, I highly recommend participating in this creative and enjoyable mystery tour presented by HERMES.</p>

<p>If you missed it, at least feel this joy through the online game!</p>

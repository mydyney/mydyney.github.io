## Introduction

Feeling overwhelmed about where to begin with your Tokyo trip planning?

This guide consolidates <strong>flights, entry (Visit Japan Web), accommodation location, Tokyo transportation, and essential apps</strong> into one comprehensive <strong>Tokyo Travel Preparation A to Z Checklist</strong>.

We'll also cover <strong>core principles for planning 2-night-3-day, 3-night-4-day, and 4-night-5-day itineraries</strong> to help you avoid route confusion even without a package tour.

Let's walk through this <strong>step-by-step guide that even complete beginners can follow</strong>.

## 1. Planning Your Schedule & Choosing Areas (The Big Picture)

Tokyo is much larger and more complex than Seoul.

Rather than wandering aimlessly, <strong>defining your 'travel theme' first helps minimize travel time</strong>.

### Best Times to Visit Tokyo

- <strong>🌸 Spring (late March&ndash;April) / 🍁 Autumn (October&ndash;November)</strong>  
  Pleasant weather and cherry blossoms or autumn leaves make this the most reliable season for first-time Tokyo visitors.

- <strong>🎄 Winter (December&ndash;January)</strong>  
  Perfect for shopping trips with city illuminations and early January <strong>Hatsuuri (first sale)</strong>.

<strong>🌸 Planning a spring 2026 trip? Must-read!</strong>  
The official Tokyo cherry blossom forecast has been released. Check the dates and weather to plan your schedule.  
👉 <strong>[2026 Tokyo Cherry Blossom Forecast (March 22) | Bloom Dates, Tokyo March Weather & Clothing](/posts/tokyo-cherry-blossom-forecast-2026/)</strong>

---

### Times to Avoid

- <strong>Golden Week (typically around April 29~May 5)</strong>  
  Extended holidays can quickly drive up flight and accommodation prices with large crowds.

- <strong>Silver Week (mid-to-late September)</strong>  
  Depending on the year, extended holidays can significantly increase accommodation costs.

- <strong>Year-end/New Year (December 31~January 3)</strong>  
  Department stores and restaurants often close, requiring advance business hour checks.

- <strong>Midsummer (July&ndash;August)</strong>  
  Very hot and humid (except during fireworks festival periods).

📌 If it's your first Tokyo trip, <strong>3 nights 4 days</strong> is most manageable. When planning routes, divide into two main zones—west (Shinjuku, Shibuya) and east (Asakusa, Ginza)—for foolproof planning.

📌 Once you've determined these major routes, choosing an 'observation deck' as a daily highlight is important.  
Wondering whether to include Shibuya Sky, Tokyo Tower, or Skytree?

## 2. Flights & Airport Selection (Narita vs Haneda)

Once your schedule is set, it's time to book flights.

Tokyo has two airports: <strong>Narita Airport (NRT)</strong> and <strong>Haneda Airport (HND)</strong>. Choose based on your budget and travel style.

<table class="schedule-table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Narita Airport (NRT)</th>
      <th>Haneda Airport (HND)</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>City travel: &ndash;1 hour to 1.5 hours</strong></td>
      <td><strong>City travel: &ndash;30-40 minutes</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Advantage:</strong> More flights, relatively cheaper</td>
      <td><strong>Advantage:</strong> Best accessibility, Gimpo departures available</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Recommended:</strong> 4+ nights, budget travelers</td>
      <td><strong>Recommended:</strong> 2-3 nights, short trips</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### Flight Booking Tips for Best Prices

When searching flight apps (Skyscanner, Naver Flights), set your destination to <strong>Tokyo (TYO)</strong>. This lets you <strong>compare Narita (NRT) and Haneda (HND) flights simultaneously</strong>.

- <strong>Price difference:</strong> <strong>Narita flights (mostly LCC)</strong> are typically 50,000-100,000 KRW cheaper than Haneda flights (mostly full-service carriers).
- <strong>Booking timing:</strong> 3-4 months before travel, or <strong>mid-week departures (Tuesday/Wednesday)</strong> tend to be cheapest.

## 3. Entry Preparation: Visit Japan Web

### ✅ Visit Japan Web Checkpoints

- Register passport information and customs declaration all at once
- <strong>Family group registration</strong> available for family trips
- <strong>Pro tip:</strong> Airport Wi-Fi can be slow, so screenshot your QR code in advance!

**☀️ What to Do During the Day?**
Before the market opens, we recommend visiting the massive temple **'Zojoji (増上寺)'** right next door to enjoy the special scenery of the traditional temple harmonizing with Tokyo Tower. If you have time, consider going up **'Tokyo Tower'** itself to enjoy Tokyo's panoramic view, then coming down to the market in the evening—a perfect day course.

## 🔥 Campers' Top Pick: 'Tokyo Crafts'

'Tokyo Crafts' is a Japanese startup outdoor brand launched in late 2020. With aesthetic designs that pursue functional beauty and reasonable prices, it's rapidly becoming "a must-buy shopping list item for Tokyo trips" among Korean campers.

Current popular products include:

- <strong>Tents/Shelters</strong>: Tenbi, Wingfort, Epica, Night Rover
- <strong>Fire Stands:</strong> Makuraito 2 (most popular for ultra-lightweight design!)
- <strong>Tables/Shelves:</strong> Kodeunit, MFT Multi Frame Table

However, there's virtually no information on where to find these products in Tokyo. So as a 'Tokyo travel blogger', I've compiled a complete offline store list specifically for travelers.

## 🏕️ Priority 2: Tokyo Official Retailers

"I missed the popup period!" "It doesn't match my travel schedule."

Don't worry. Here's the only permanent retailer in Tokyo registered on the official website.

## 🏪 MAX CAMP (Tokyo Ota Ward)

As of November 2025, this is the only official retailer in Tokyo!

- <strong>Travel Tip:</strong> The location is in Ota Ward (大田区), very close to Haneda Airport (HND). (Convenient via Keikyu Line)

- <strong>Recommended Route:</strong>
1. First day arriving at Haneda Airport
2. Last day of trip, stop on the way from city to airport - perfect location for shopping!

- <strong>Note:</strong> Depending on store size, smaller gear like Makuraito 2 fire stands and Kodeunit may be displayed more than large tents like Tenbi and Wingfort, so we recommend checking with the store before visiting.

## 💡 Pro Tips for Travelers (Q&A)

Tips <strong>only for travelers</strong> that camping blogs don't have.

<strong>Q. Do 'Kodeunit' tables or 'Makuraito 2' fire stands fit in carry-on luggage?</strong>

- <strong>✈️ Tents (Tenbi·Wingfort etc.) → Must be checked baggage.</strong> (For LCC users, fees may apply for exceeding weight/quantity limits, so check airline regulations in advance.)
- <strong>🔥 Fire stands (Makuraito 2 etc.) → New products can be checked.</strong> (However, if there are signs of use or ash, they cannot be brought on board)
- <strong>🧳 Luggage Storage</strong>: Makuraito 2 (A4 size level) and Kodeunit (shelf) pack very compactly and fit sufficiently in 24-inch or larger suitcases.
- <strong>🚨 Absolutely No Carry-On: Must be processed as checked baggage.</strong> (Classified as metal parts/tools with high probability of being caught in security screening.)

<strong>Q. How does it compare to Korea popup (GOCAF) prices?</strong>

Basic list prices are similar, but with <strong>recent weak yen + 10% tax-free benefit (+ 5% additional discount coupon)</strong>, <strong>buying locally in Tokyo is much more likely to be cheaper.</strong>

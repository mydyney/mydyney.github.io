## 🤔 Tsukiji Market—Didn't It Close?

<p>This is the most confusing part for many visitors. The short answer: "Half true, half false."</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Tsukiji Inner Market (Wholesale/Auction):</b> Relocated to <b>Toyosu Market</b> in 2018. This is where the famous early-morning tuna auctions used to take place.</li>
  <li><b>Tsukiji Outer Market (Retail/Food):</b> Still operating under the name <b>"Tsukiji Outer Market"</b>. This is the "food paradise" where we enjoy sushi, kaisendon, and street food when traveling.</li>
</ul>

<p>✅ <b>Bottom line: We're visiting the "Tsukiji Outer Market," and it's still in the same location!</b></p>

## 🕒 Essential Info Before Visiting Tsukiji Market (Access, Hours, Closed Days)

### 🚇 How to Get There by Subway

<ul>
  <li>Toei Oedo Line: <b>Tsukijishijo Station</b> (Exit A1) <b>Most recommended!</b> The market entrance is visible from the station exit.</li>
  <li>Tokyo Metro: <b>Tsukiji Station</b> (Exits 1, 2) Also very close, about 2-3 minutes walk.</li>
</ul>

### 🕒 Operating Hours: "Morning" is Prime Time!

<p>Tsukiji Market has different atmospheres depending on the time of day.</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>6:00 AM - 9:00 AM:</b> When professionals (chefs, etc.) purchase fresh ingredients. Very crowded and lively—you'll see the market's true character, but be careful not to obstruct traffic.</li>
  <li><b>9:00 AM - 2:00 PM:</b> Best time for tourists. Most restaurants and street food stalls are actively operating, making it the most comfortable time to enjoy the market.</li>
  <li><b>After 2:00 PM:</b> Many shops start closing, so it's recommended to arrive by 1:00 PM at the latest.</li>
</ul>

### 🗓️ Closed Days: Avoid "Wednesdays" and "Sundays"!

<p>Tsukiji Outer Market is basically closed on <b>Sundays</b> and <b>public holidays</b>. Additionally, many shops close on <b>Wednesdays</b> following the wholesale market's closure schedule.</p>

<p><b>⚠️ Important:</b> These closure days are the market's official standards, but some shops in the outer market may close on different days or operate temporarily. <b>If you have a specific shop you want to visit, it's safest to check its operating status on Google Maps before your visit.</b></p>

## 🕌 Tsukiji Market's Unique Landmark: Tsukiji Honganji

<p>Across the street from Tsukiji Market, you'll see a massive building with an exotic appearance that's hard to believe is a Japanese temple—this is <b><a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/tfXmnjVCCsBn8KZ97" target="_blank">'Tsukiji Honganji'</a></b>. Built in ancient Indian Buddhist architectural style, it offers a unique charm, and the modern cafe <b><a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/JELw8SfKDk3ngnF27" target="_blank">'Tsumugi'</a></b> inside the temple grounds serves an elegant <b>'18-dish breakfast'</b> that's very popular on social media. (The 18-dish breakfast often sells out early, so you need to arrive at opening time!)</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Hours:</b> 8:00 AM - 6:00 PM</li>
</ul>

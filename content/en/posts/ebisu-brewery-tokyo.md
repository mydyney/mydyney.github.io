When you see the Ebisu Brewery Tokyo sign, head to B1F. The sound of flowing water along the path creates a peaceful atmosphere.

## 1. Beer Tasting at the Taproom

The taproom is a space where you can taste various Yebisu beers, including special brewery-exclusive beers not available in stores. The beer selection changes seasonally, and the available types are displayed at the entrance.

<figure>

</figure>

At the taproom entrance, you take a number and order at the counter. As a first-time visitor wanting to try all the beers, I ordered a Beer Flight, which offers multiple beers at once.

A tap is the device that pours beer fresh from the brewery without filtering or additional processing.

Today's Beer Flight featured, from left to right: Yebisu ∞ (Infinity), Everhop Weizen, Yebisu ∞ Black, and today's special beer.

For snacks, I ordered the Three Smoke Plate. The salty ham and cheese pair perfectly with the beer.

The Beer Flight was great for finding beers that match your taste. It was fun choosing between beers with smooth sweetness, clean hoppy bitterness, refreshing lemon-like tartness, and complex fruit and caramel flavors.

I ordered another glass of my new favorite, 'Yebisu ∞ (Infinity)'.

To remember today's experience, I took a photo of the menu. Since the beer selection changes each season, I'm already planning to return next season!

## 2. Beer Brewery

The Yebisu beer brewery is equipped with German brewing equipment, and you can directly observe the beer-making process on-site.

Curious about the "Beer is ∞ (Beer is Infinite)" slogan, I learned that the yeast used in Yebisu ∞ and Yebisu ∞ Black was reselected from the yeast used in the old Yebisu brewery and revived for modern times. These two beers are the flagship products of Ebisu Brewery Tokyo and can be tasted year-round.

Hop flowers and various malts are on display. Malt is made by germinating and drying grains, which helps beer fermentation and determines its flavor and color.

## 3. Yebisu Beer Museum

Yebisu beer was established in 1890 by introducing German brewing technology and became a premium beer. The brand name and logo are derived from 'Ebisu (恵比寿)', the god of good fortune. During the restructuring of the Japanese beer industry in 1906, Yebisu beer merged with Sapporo beer and was absorbed as a Sapporo beer brand. Yebisu beer is considered Sapporo beer's premium line.

</figure>

Ebisu Station was established in 1901 to transport beer cargo, and as Yebisu beer became famous, even the area name became Ebisu. The street connecting Ebisu Station and Yebisu Garden Place is called Beer-zaka (ビア坂) and features various restaurants and cafes. The beer mug-shaped street lamps along the street are unique.

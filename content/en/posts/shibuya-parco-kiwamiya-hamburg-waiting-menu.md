If you've traveled to Fukuoka, you've probably heard of or seen the long lines at **Kiwamiya Hamburg**. Many visitors gave up due to the wait times.

"Is there one in Tokyo?" **Yes, there is!** And it's located in the best shopping spot - **Shibuya Parco** basement floor.

Whenever friends ask me about Tokyo restaurants, this is one place I tell them to visit **"even if it means waiting."** To be honest, if you just show up, expect to wait 1-2 hours minimum.

However, knowing the **special menu items and hidden timing secrets** unique to the Shibuya location will make your experience much more satisfying. Based on official information, here's your complete guide to conquering Kiwamiya Hamburg at Shibuya Parco.

## 1. Tokyo Station vs Shibuya Parco: Which Location?

There are two locations in Tokyo: Tokyo Station and Shibuya Parco. For food lovers, I recommend **Shibuya Parco** for two reasons:

**1. Better Waiting Environment**: The Chaos Kitchen area in Parco's basement is much more comfortable than Tokyo Station's crowded corridors.

**2. Exclusive Menu**: Only Shibuya offers the **Kobe Beef Hamburg** and premium steak combos.

### 🍯 Sauce & Topping Tips

Five sauces are provided (rock salt, wasabi, sweet sauce, onion sauce, meat sauce) to enjoy as you like.

- **Recommended Topping**: "Ran-Ou Sauce" with truffle-infused salt (198 yen). Dipping the meat in the rich egg yolk creates an explosion of flavor.

## 4. Enjoying the Teppan Style

This is Kiwamiya's first teppan-style location. With 24 bar-style seats, it's perfect for solo dining.

1. The hamburg arrives in a rare state, lightly seared on the outside.
2. Use **silver chopsticks** to tear off pieces of meat (for raw meat).
3. Place on the hot teppan and flip to cook.
4. Once cooked, use **wooden chopsticks** to pick up and dip in your choice of sauce, then place on freshly cooked rice. (Must separate chopsticks!)

**🍚 Rice, soup, salad, and dessert ice cream are all unlimited refills.**

When you need more, don't hesitate to say:
**"🥗 Gohan/Soup/Salada/Soft Cream Okawari Kudasai"**
(Rice/Soup/Salad/Ice Cream refill please)

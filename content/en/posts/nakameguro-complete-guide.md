## � Waiting for Spring, Nakameguro Cherry Blossom Season Tips

<p>Nakameguro is famous as the best cherry blossom spot in Tokyo. Every year from late March to early April, the cherry blossoms forming a tunnel on both sides of the Meguro River are truly spectacular.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Season:</strong> Usually last week of March ~ First week of April</li>
  <li><strong>Caution:</strong> During the cherry blossom season, it is crowded without room to step, so if you want a leisurely trip, avoiding this period is also a way. Rather, if you visit in other seasons, you can feel the quiet charm of Nakameguro more deeply.</li>
</ul>

## 💡 'Daikanyama' Good to Bundle Together

<p>If you walk about 15 minutes along the hill from Nakameguro, you can reach <strong>'Daikanyama'</strong>, a neighborhood with another charm. If Nakameguro has a cute riverbank sensibility, Daikanyama is characterized by luxury boutiques, sophisticated select shops, and complex cultural spaces represented by 'Tsutaya Books'. We recommend a course of spending half a day in Nakameguro and half a day in Daikanyama.</p>

## How to Get to HOUSE

HOUSE is on the 7th floor of the Shin-Marunouchi Building. The building is directly connected underground to the north exit of Tokyo Station on the Marunouchi Line. JR Tokyo Station, Otemachi Station, and Nijubashimae Station are all within a 10-minute walk.

If you've visited KITTE or the Marunouchi Building, the Shin-Marunouchi Building is the one across the street with the BEAMS store.

HOUSE has 12 restaurants and bars along with an outdoor open terrace. Head to the Station Side to see the Tokyo Station night view.

Order food from any restaurant, then find a seat on the open terrace. The terrace with Tokyo Station night view is incredibly romantic.

## HOUSE Guide Map

What restaurants are inside HOUSE? Here's the 7th floor restaurant guide map.

Many people mistake the Shin-Marunouchi Building 7F open terrace for a free observatory, but strictly speaking, this is a restaurant area, not a free observation deck. Please make sure to purchase food before using the terrace. There's a great variety of cuisines available, so you can pick and choose like at a food court.

I chose a warm lemon tea and tacos for a light meal while enjoying the night view. Here's restaurant #4.

Restaurant #8 is a great choice when it's cold - nothing beats a warm bowl of soba on a chilly day.

## HOUSE Food

Lemon tea and shrimp tacos. Dining on the open terrace felt cozy with ambient lighting and warm heaters. The food somehow tasted even better with the Tokyo Station night view as a backdrop.

## HOUSE Night View

HOUSE is open until 11:00 PM, but the Tokyo Station illumination only runs from sunset until 9:00 PM. Keep this in mind when planning your visit.

## Epilogue

I highly recommend this spot for anyone who wants to enjoy a variety of food while taking in the beautiful Tokyo Station night view. There's no waiting time, so you can save precious travel time too.

The wide-open terrace with a panoramic view of Tokyo Station is the biggest draw here.

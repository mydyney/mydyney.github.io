## **1. Nintendo TOKYO - Tickets, Waiting & Goods**

This is the place that attracts the most crowds on Shibuya Parco 6F. On weekdays, entry is relatively free, but on **weekends or holidays**, there are so many people that you may not even be able to enter without a **'numbered ticket'**.

- **Distribution Days:** Saturdays, Sundays, public holidays, and other days when crowds are expected
- **Distribution Time:** Usually starts between **9:30 AM - 10:00 AM** before opening
- **Distribution Location:**
  - **Before Opening:** Parco 1F '**Spain-zaka**' entrance (outdoor stairs side)
  - **After Opening:** 6F outdoor stairs entrance in front of Mario statue (1 per person)
- **Entry Method:** Check the entry time available with the numbered ticket QR code, and visit the 6F store at that time

### **✅ Pokemon Card (TCG) Purchase Tips & Precautions**

If you're planning to buy Pokemon cards at Shibuya Pokemon Center, be sure to check! (Based on 2025 latest policy)

**1. Cards are at the register**

Popular expansion packs are sold at the **register (Cashier)**, not on display shelves. Don't give up if they're not on the shelves, ask at checkout.

**2. Purchase Limit per Person**

To prevent reselling, there are strict quantity limits like '5 packs per person' or '10 packs per person'. Popular packs often sell out (SOLD OUT) in the morning.

**3. Shrink (Plastic) Removal Policy (Important!)**

Even if you buy by the box, staff will remove the plastic wrap (shrink) on site and hand it to you. Keep this in mind when buying for unopened collection!

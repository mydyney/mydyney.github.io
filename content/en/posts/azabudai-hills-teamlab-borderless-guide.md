## Wander, Explore, Discover

<p>True to its nickname — "the museum without a map" — teamLab Borderless has no boundaries between artworks, no set viewing order, and no explanations.</p>

<p>There are no room names, no marked beginning or end. Visitors get lost, find their way, and discover their own unique artworks along the journey.</p>

## EN Tea House

<p>Hidden somewhere inside the exhibition, EN TEA HOUSE is a truly special space. There's no additional admission fee, but you need to purchase a drink to enter.</p>

<p>When your tea is poured, flowers bloom inside the teacup. As you drink, the flowers continue to bloom endlessly, transforming into an infinite world right before your eyes.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Opens:</strong> 10:00 AM (1 hour after the museum opens)</li>
</ul>
<p>※ Last order: 30 minutes before closing</p>

## How teamLab Borderless Differs from teamLab Planets

<p>teamLab Borderless and teamLab Planets Tokyo are both immersive digital art experiences by teamLab, but they differ significantly in concept and style.</p>

<p>teamLab Borderless removes all boundaries between artworks — the entire space is designed like a maze where visitors freely explore and become part of the art. In contrast, teamLab Planets focuses on sensory immersion: visitors take off their shoes and walk through water, physically interacting with the artworks along a set route.</p>

<p>At Borderless, you wander freely through a maze-like space with no fixed path. At Planets, you follow a guided sequence of rooms.</p>

<p>teamLab Planets Tokyo is located at Shintoyosu Station (Yurikamome Line).</p>

---

## Epilogue

<p>teamLab Borderless carries a message about applying the persistence, change, and harmony experienced within the artworks to our own lives — making the world a more beautiful place. The visit takes longer than you might expect, so plan your schedule with plenty of time to spare.</p>

Today, I'll introduce the trendy **Human Made** offline store located in Shibuya Parco.

Recently, the Human Made store in Shibuya Parco has undergone a renewal and expansion! Before, everything was gathered in one place, making it extremely crowded. Now, it has been separated into **PART 1 (Clothing)** and **PART 2 (General Goods)** to provide a more pleasant shopping environment.

However, since the locations are completely different, many people get confused. I will organize the location of each part, the items sold, and the waiting method perfectly for you!

## 1. Waiting System (Entry Line & Numbered Tickets)

Human Made is so popular that there is almost always a line. especially on **Drop Days (Saturdays)** or collaboration release days, they operate a **Numbered Ticket System** to prevent congestion.

### 🎫 What is a Numbered Ticket?
It determines your **entry order**, but it is **NOT a guaranteed purchase ticket**. Even if you enter, popular items may already be sold out by your turn.

*   **Purpose:** To prevent overcrowding and long lines in front of the store.
*   **Caution:** Having a ticket does not guarantee you can buy what you want.

### 📢 Distribution Method (Random vs First-come)
The method changes depending on the release day. **You MUST check the official Instagram for announcements.**
*   **Random Lottery (Most Common):** Numbered tickets are distributed randomly to people gathered at a specific time and place. (If you draw a "blank", you cannot enter.)
*   **First-come, First-served:** Numbers are given in arrival order. (On popular days, it ends instantly.)

### 📌 How to Get a Ticket
*   **Location:** Usually distributed at the **Shibuya Parco 1F outside passage**. Look for staff holding signs/placards.
*   **Required Item:** **Passport (ID) is ESSENTIAL!** They check ID very strictly.
*   **Warning:** Strictly **1 ticket per person** to prevent resale. If you are late for the gathering time, distribution ends immediately.

On normal weekdays, you can usually enter by scanning a **QR code** at the store entrance if there is a line.

## 2. PART 1: Clothing Specialty Store (Inside Parco)

**PART 1** is the space where mainly **clothing** is displayed. It is located inside the Parco building, so it is easy to find.

*   **Location:** Shibuya Parco 1F (Inside)
*   **Items:** T-shirts, hoodies, varsity jackets, padding, pants, outerwear, etc.
*   **Vibe:** A spacious layout where you can leisurely look at clothes and try them on.

## 3. PART 2: Accessories & General Goods (Outside Parco)

**PART 2** is a space that collects **accessories and lifestyle goods**. Be careful as it is located **outside** the Parco building, not inside!

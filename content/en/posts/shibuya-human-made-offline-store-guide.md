Today, I'll introduce the trendy **Human Made** offline store located in Shibuya Parco.

Recently, the Human Made store in Shibuya Parco has undergone a renewal and expansion! Before, everything was gathered in one place, making it extremely crowded. Now, it has been separated into **PART 1 (Clothing)** and **PART 2 (General Goods)** to provide a more pleasant shopping environment.

However, since the locations are completely different, many people get confused. I will organize the location of each part, the items sold, and the waiting method perfectly for you!

## 1. Waiting System (Entry Line)

Human Made is so popular that there is almost always a line.

*   **Weekdays:** You can usually enter immediately without a long wait.
*   **Weekends/Holidays:** There is a high probability of a waiting line.
*   **Launch Days:** On days when new products are released, you may need a numbered ticket.

If there is a line, follow the staff's instructions to scan the **QR code** and register for waiting. You will receive a notification on your smartphone when it's your turn to enter, so you can look around Parco in the meantime.

## 2. PART 1: Clothing Specialty Store (Inside Parco)

**PART 1** is the space where mainly **clothing** is displayed. It is located inside the Parco building, so it is easy to find.

*   **Location:** Shibuya Parco 1F (Inside)
*   **Items:** T-shirts, hoodies, varsity jackets, padding, pants, outerwear, etc.
*   **Vibe:** A spacious layout where you can leisurely look at clothes and try them on.

## 3. PART 2: Accessories & General Goods (Outside Parco)

**PART 2** is a space that collects **accessories and lifestyle goods**. Be careful as it is located **outside** the Parco building, not inside!

It is a newly created space and **does not connect from inside the Parco building!** You must go out to the 1st floor.

*   **Location:** Shibuya Parco 1F Exterior
*   **Items:** Keyrings, hats, bags, lifestyle goods
*   **How to get there:** Follow the alley between the Parco buildings to see the dedicated entrance.

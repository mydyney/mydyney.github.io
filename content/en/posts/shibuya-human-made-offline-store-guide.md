<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.1rem; color: #555;">Today, I'll introduce the trendy Human Made offline store located in Shibuya Parco.</p>

Today, I'll introduce the trendy <strong>Human Made</strong> offline store located in Shibuya Parco.

Recently, the Human Made store in Shibuya Parco has undergone a renewal and expansion! Before, everything was gathered in one place, making it extremely crowded. Now, it has been separated into <strong>PART 1 (Clothing)</strong> and <strong>PART 2 (General Goods)</strong> to provide a more pleasant shopping environment.

However, since the locations are completely different, many people get confused. I will organize the location of each part, the items sold, and the waiting method perfectly for you!

## 1. Waiting System (Entry Line & Numbered Tickets)

Human Made is so popular that there is almost always a line. especially on <strong>Drop Days (Saturdays)</strong> or collaboration release days, they operate a <strong>Numbered Ticket System</strong> to prevent congestion.

### 🎫 What is a Numbered Ticket?
It determines your <strong>entry order</strong>, but it is <strong>NOT a guaranteed purchase ticket</strong>. Even if you enter, popular items may already be sold out by your turn.

*   <strong>Purpose:</strong> To prevent overcrowding and long lines in front of the store.
*   <strong>Caution:</strong> Having a ticket does not guarantee you can buy what you want.

### 📢 Distribution Method (Random vs First-come)
The method changes depending on the release day. <strong>You MUST check the official Instagram for announcements.</strong>

*   <strong>Random Lottery (Most Common):</strong> Numbered tickets are distributed randomly to people gathered at a specific time and place. (If you draw a "blank", you cannot enter.)
*   <strong>First-come, First-served:</strong> Numbers are given in arrival order. (On popular days, it ends instantly.)

### 📌 How to Get a Ticket
*   <strong>Location:</strong> Usually distributed at the <strong>Shibuya Parco 1F outside passage</strong>. Look for staff holding signs/placards.
*   <strong>Required Item:</strong> <strong>Passport (ID) is ESSENTIAL!</strong> They check ID very strictly.
*   <strong>Warning:</strong> Strictly <strong>1 ticket per person</strong> to prevent resale. If you are late for the gathering time, distribution ends immediately.

On normal weekdays, you can usually enter by scanning a <strong>QR code</strong> at the store entrance if there is a line.

## 2. PART 1: Clothing Specialty Store (Inside Parco)

<strong>PART 1</strong> is the space where mainly <strong>clothing</strong> is displayed. It is located inside the Parco building, so it is easy to find.

*   <strong>Location:</strong> Shibuya Parco 1F (Inside)
*   <strong>Items:</strong> T-shirts, hoodies, varsity jackets, padding, pants, outerwear, etc.
*   <strong>Vibe:</strong> A spacious layout where you can leisurely look at clothes and try them on.

## 3. PART 2: Accessories & General Goods (Outside Parco)

<strong>PART 2</strong> is a space that collects <strong>accessories and lifestyle goods</strong>. Be careful as it is located <strong>outside</strong> the Parco building, not inside!

*   <strong>Location:</strong> Shibuya Parco 1F Exterior
*   <strong>Items:</strong> Keyrings, hats, bags, lifestyle goods
*   <strong>How to get there:</strong> Follow the alley between the Parco buildings to see the dedicated entrance.

## 5. Shopping Tips (Price, Size, Tax Free)

Here are some tips for shopping at Human Made:

*   <strong>Price Range:</strong> Short sleeve T-shirts ~10,000 yen, Hoodies ~30,000 yen, Outerwear ~80,000 yen.
*   <strong>Size Tip:</strong> Based on Japanese standard sizing, the width is narrow and the fit is slim. I <strong>strongly recommend sizing up 1-2 sizes</strong> from your usual size.

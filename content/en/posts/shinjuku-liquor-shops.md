## 1. Tokyo Whisky Shopping: Why Shinjuku?

If you're planning whisky shopping in Tokyo, Shinjuku is almost a must-visit destination.

Multiple liquor shops are within walking distance from JR Shinjuku Station, making it possible to do a **"liquor shop pilgrimage"**.

Shinjuku liquor shops especially stock limited whiskies and Japanese whiskies like Yamazaki and Hibiki that are hard to find at airport duty-free shops.

## 2. Shinjuku Liquor Shop Recommended Routes (West vs East)

Liquor shops are mainly clustered in two areas: 'Nishi-Shinjuku (West)' and 'Kabukicho (East)'.

### 1️⃣ Shinjuku Station West Exit / Nishi-Shinjuku (Large Mart Style)

- **Bic Camera Shinjuku West Exit Store (Liquor Corner)** (**📍[Google Maps↗](https://maps.app.goo.gl/CLDHwXPeaDFkZ9qh6) 📍**)
- **Yamaya Shinjuku Store (Large Liquor Mart)** (**📍[Google Maps↗](https://maps.app.goo.gl/PkyvHZvbhXGrypBCA) 📍**)

Both locations offer a "warehouse-style" experience where you can shop for whisky, sake, and wine all at once.

Easy tax-free shopping and great for getting a sense of prices.

### 2️⃣ Shinjuku Kabukicho / East Exit

- **Liquor Mountain Kabukicho Store** (**📍[Google Maps↗](https://maps.app.goo.gl/4NnDyF3dRUeAso6L8) 📍**)
- **Shinanoya Shinjuku Store** (**📍[Google Maps↗](https://maps.app.goo.gl/f3JvMt91CncngYGJ7) 📍**)
- **Whisky Kingdom** (ウイスキー王国) (**📍[Google Maps↗](https://maps.app.goo.gl/TPF1xddeSffCZhhW9) 📍**)

This area has a slightly higher chance of finding Japanese whisky or rare bottles.

## 3. Where to Buy Yamazaki, Hibiki, and Kavalan at Shinjuku Liquor Shops?

This is the main reason travelers visit Shinjuku liquor shops.

### 🍷 Shinjuku Liquor Shops **Yamazaki**

Yamazaki has the fiercest competition. If you see it on the shelf, grab it immediately.

- **Stores**: Yamaya → Liquor Mountain → Shinanoya
- **Stock**: 'Yamazaki 12 Year' and older are hard to find outside release seasons, and 'Non-Age (NA)' sometimes appears during opening runs.

### 🍸 Shinjuku Liquor Shops **Hibiki**

Hibiki is slightly easier to find than Yamazaki.

- **Stores**: Yamaya, Shinanoya, Whisky Kingdom, etc.
- **Stock**: Hibiki Blender's Choice, Hibiki Japanese Harmony
- **Price**: Cheaper than airport duty-free or domestic prices, but often with a premium markup.

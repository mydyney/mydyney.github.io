<hr>

## 1. Overwhelming Scale: Gachapon Forest

The first shop to introduce is **Shinjuku Gachapon Forest (Gachagacha no Mori)**. True to its name meaning "Forest of Gacha," stepping inside feels like entering a 360-degree forest surrounded by capsule toys.

### 🟢 Gachapon Forest Shinjuku Subnade Branch

- **Location:** Shinjuku Subnade underground shopping area (B1F)
  *(5-minute walk from Shinjuku East Exit)* **[📍[Google Maps↗](https://maps.app.goo.gl/QGGTYMzfA1btyUMB6) 📍]**
- **Hours:** 10:30 AM ~ 9:00 PM
- **Machines:** Approximately 1,050 units
- **Features:** Access through the underground shopping area means you can move around comfortably even when it's raining or hot.

**💡 Pro Tip:** The nearby major chain "C-pla" is also close, so combining both locations gives you access to about 2,000 machines just underground.

### Where to Find Shinjuku Gashapon Bus Bell/Stop Bell?

I found a rare item here! While I didn't find the highly sought-after **Shinjuku gacha bus bell (stop bell)**, I discovered an emergency stop button gacha instead. It's the kind of subway emergency button you should never press normally, and it's 400 yen. When you press it, it makes a realistic "BUZZ!" warning sound that's incredibly satisfying for stress relief.

</figure>

It's truly a gacha paradise! 😍 The **Sanrio desk clock** and **Rilakkuma (Bear) keychains** that I only saw at this Shinjuku gashapon shop had fresh stock too. Especially the Sanrio clock at 500 yen – it's genuinely cute on your desk, so grab it if you see one!

## 2. Best Accessibility: C-pla

Located on the busiest street at Shinjuku's East Exit, it's the most convenient to drop by while passing through. It's right near the Disney Flagship Store.

### 🟣 C-pla Shinjuku

- **Location:** Adhoc Building 1F & M2F (street-facing)
  *(5-minute walk from Shinjuku East Exit)* **[📍[Google Maps↗](https://maps.app.goo.gl/QFyUL7AarFphWVzs9) 📍]**
- **Hours:** 10:00 AM ~ 10:00 PM (open late)
- **Machines:** Approximately 900 units
- **Features:** Very fast turnover for latest trending character goods like Sanrio and Chiikawa. The store is laid out in a long corridor format, making it easy to browse.

## 3. Late Night Hotspot: Kabukicho Tower Namco Tokyo

Are Tokyo nights long but shops close early? Then head to **Shinjuku Kabukicho Tower**. It's the only place to enjoy gashapon until the early morning.

### 🔵 Namco Tokyo

- **Location:** Shinjuku Kabukicho Tower 3F
  *(8-minute walk from Shinjuku East Exit)* **[📍[Google Maps↗](https://maps.app.goo.gl/E1w5WrhzpAFMi1wt8) 📍]**
- **Hours:** 11:00 AM ~ **1:00 AM (25:00)**
- **Machines:** 250 units
- **Features:** Cyberpunk interior with flashy neon signs makes for amazing photos. It's an "adult playground" where you can enjoy beer or cocktails at the bar while getting gacha. 🍻
- **Suica/Pasmo** payment available – perfect for using up remaining IC card balance!

**✅ [Check Online Stock Information](https://bandainamco-am.co.jp/others/gashapon-bandai-officialshop/store/namco_tokyo/)**

**⚠️ Note:** Due to the Kabukicho area's nature, there may be touts late at night. Use main streets when traveling.

</figure>

At Namco Tokyo, I found the **'Encyclopedia of Creatures - Stag Beetle'** series that kids love. It's scanned from real insects so it's realistically detailed. The wings open and all the legs move for 500 yen! Way cheaper than in Korea, so insect enthusiasts should definitely grab these.

## 4. Shopping Combo: Bic Camera (Honest Review)

Many blogs recommend this, but **for gacha-only visits, it might be disappointing.**

### 🟠 Bic Camera Shinjuku Higashiguchi Store

- **Location:** Bic Camera Shinjuku Higashiguchi Store 6F
  *(5-minute walk from Shinjuku East Exit)* **[📍[Google Maps↗](https://maps.app.goo.gl/WpHWvCfXPY6tWpPD8) 📍]**
- **Hours:** 10:00 AM ~ 10:00 PM (year-round)
- **Machines:** Approximately 100-150 units (smaller scale)
- **Honest Check:** Significantly fewer machines compared to dedicated gashapon shops (C-pla, Nomori). While there are rumors about rare items at Shinjuku Bic Camera gashapon, they're often out of stock, so be cautious.
- **Recommended For:** Rather than making a special trip, it's better as a light browse when shopping at the **6F toy section or Canmake**.

## 5. Official Bandai Shop: Gashapon Bandai

If you're looking for the official "Bandai" shop, head to Marui Department Store. It's packed with quality guaranteed authentic gashapon.

### 🔴 Gashapon Bandai Official Shop (Shinjuku Gashapon Sanctuary)

- **Location:** Shinjuku Marui (0101) Annex Department Store 6F
  *(Shinjuku-sanchome Station Exit C4 / 8-minute walk from Shinjuku Station Southeast Exit)* **[📍[Google Maps↗](https://maps.app.goo.gl/sSrJQBa91TP18xzB7) 📍]**
- **Hours:** Weekdays 11:00 AM ~ 8:00 PM (Sundays/holidays open at 10:30)

Here I discovered Bandai's cosmetic brand **'CreerBeaute'** gacha! 💍 It's a ring you can wear on your finger, and when you open the lid, it works as **lip balm + cheek tint + shadow**. With popular characters like Kuromi and Cinnamoroll, and at 500 yen, it's perfect as **gifts (omiyage)**.

Have you seen **'flat gacha'**? 😲 Called **flat gashapon**, these come without capsules – A4 clear files or coasters come out directly! No capsule waste, and easy to slip into your bag, making them perfect souvenirs. Snoopy and Moomin coasters were so cute I couldn't resist getting them.

## 📸 [Odaiba] Island of Romance & Entertainment

<strong>⭐ Landmarks & Photo Zones</strong>

<strong>🗽 Statue of Liberty: Symbol of Friendship from 'Paris', Not New York</strong>

- <strong>Plot Twist:</strong> Symbolizes friendship with Paris, France - not New York.
- <strong>TMI:</strong> In 1998, temporarily borrowed from Paris for 'Year of France in Japan' celebrations. Became so popular that with France's permission, a permanent replica was erected in 2000.

</figure>

<strong>🌉 Rainbow Bridge: The Real 'Rainbow' Only Once a Year!</strong>

- <strong>Plot Twist:</strong> Despite its name, it's not rainbow-colored normally! (Cool white in summer, warm white in winter)
- <strong>Real Rainbow: When?</strong> Only once a year during year-end season (December), the main towers illuminate in brilliant rainbow colors.

<h3>🎁 Weekday Limited Bonus (Real Visit Review!)</h3>

<p>The official website announced on September 25 that a newly-drawn 'original card' would be given to weekday visitors as a special bonus.</p>

<p>✨ I visited on the first day (Friday around sunset) expecting this bonus, but unfortunately didn't receive it. 😭</p>

<p>It appears the cards were depleted quickly due to the first-day crowd, or the quantity was very limited to begin with. If you're visiting specifically for the weekday bonus, I highly recommend arriving very early (opening time rush) or keep in mind you might not receive it!</p>

<h3>2️⃣ From TV Series to Rebuild Films (Production Materials Exhibition)</h3>

<p>This Roppongi Evangelion exhibition's core is publicly revealing production materials from 30 years of history on an 'unprecedented scale'. You can glimpse the entire production process from the legendary 1995 TV series to the recently completed Rebuild films.</p>

<h4>(1) Initial Planning: The Work's Blueprint</h4>

<p>On October 4, 1995, the 'Neon Genesis Evangelion' TV series was born after countless trials and errors. This exhibition allows you to directly witness the birth through original 'setting materials' - the blueprints that show how this vast worldview was conceived.</p>

<div class="image-group-2">

</div>

<h4>(2) TV Series: 270 Original Cel Artworks 🖼️</h4>

<p>The 'cel' animation technique used at the time involved drawing directly on transparent film. This exhibition, in cooperation with ATAC (Animation and Special Effects Archive founded by Director Hideaki Anno), carefully selected and displays approximately 270 pieces from over 10,000 existing cels.</p>

<p>This is essentially a unique opportunity to see precious originals of a now-vanished production method.</p>

<h4>(3) Rebuild Films [:1.0, :2.0, :3.0]: Key Animation and Layouts</h4>

<p>In 2007, Evangelion was reborn as a new story with Rebuild 1.0. Through 2.0 and 3.0, it showed completely different developments from the TV series. This section showcases how the unique visual beauty of the 'Rebuild' films was achieved through hand-drawn key animation and layout materials showing frame composition.</p>

The exhibition deeply revisits the series finale through setting materials and key animation, showing how it constantly evolved from hand-drawn to digital production, even incorporating live-action techniques.</p>

<h3>3️⃣ Obsession with 'Sound' (Audio Materials, Previews)</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>🎧 Voice Actor Audition Recordings:</strong> Precious audition audio materials from voice actors who have become legendary are partially revealed. You can hear directly how characters were born through their voices.</li>
<li><strong>🎬 Storyboards and Previews:</strong> Along with <strong>storyboards</strong> that form the basis of film production, a compilation of TV series preview videos featuring the memorable narration by 'Misato Katsuragi' is also screened.

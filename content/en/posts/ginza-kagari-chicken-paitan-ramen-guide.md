## 2. How the Queue Works (Process & Tips)

<p><strong>Queue Process:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>When you arrive, line up on the <strong>left side</strong>.</li>
<li>When it's your turn, follow staff instructions to <strong>order and pay</strong>, then receive your ticket.</li>
<li>After purchasing your ticket, move to the <strong>right side</strong> and wait in line.</li>
<li>Once guided to your seat, hand over your ticket — done!</li>
</ol>

## 4. Broth Comparison: Honest Reviews of All Three

<p>The interior features 18 U-shaped counter seats. The atmosphere feels more like a high-end sushi omakase or kappo restaurant than a ramen shop — calm, modern, and refined.</p>

</figure>

<p><strong>1. [Overwhelming Aroma] Truffle Tori Paitan Soba (¥3,000)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The menu's No.1 pick.</strong> The moment the bowl arrives, the intense truffle aroma hits you.</li>
<li>Unlike the regular options, the toppings are beautifully plated on top of the broth. The visual presentation alone justifies its Michelin Bib Gourmand status. When the truffle oil blends into the creamy chicken broth, the flavor truly explodes.</li>
</ul>

</figure>

<p><strong>2. [Pure Elegance] Original Tori Paitan Soba (¥2,000)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We ordered this to compare the <strong>original broth flavor</strong> without the truffle.</li>
<li>With the <strong>special upgrade (+¥400)</strong>, toppings arrive on a separate plate, presented like kaiseki cuisine. The experience of dipping each topping into the broth one by one is delightful. This is the best choice for those who want to savor the pure richness of the chicken broth.</li>
</ul>

</figure>

<p><strong>3. [Savory Depth] Shoyu (Soy Sauce) Tori Paitan Soba (¥2,000)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>If you don't like heavy flavors</strong>, this is a strong recommendation. The special soy sauce blend (kaeshi) gives the milky broth a slightly deeper color and richer umami.</li>
<li>While the original is "milky smoothness," the Shoyu version adds a <strong>savory, salty depth</strong> that leaves a clean, refreshing aftertaste.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>💡 Final Verdict:</strong> After sharing all three, the balance of <strong>Truffle (aroma) – Original (richness) – Shoyu (umami)</strong> was perfect. If you're visiting with 3 or more people, order different types and compare the broths!</p>

## 5. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

<p><strong>Q1. What is tori paitan?</strong></p>
<p>A. It refers to a broth made by slowly simmering chicken (tori) until it turns milky white (paitan). One sip and you'll notice your lips sticking together slightly — that's how rich it is. There's absolutely no gamey taste, just an explosion of savory umami. The seasonal vegetable toppings (tomato, bamboo shoots, leafy greens) add not only color but a crunchy texture that balances the richness.</p>
<p>The noodles are firm, medium-thick, and soak up every drop of broth. Halfway through, try adding a dash of yuzu vinegar or pepper from the table — it elevates the flavor to a whole new level.</p>

<p><strong>Q2. How should I eat the side toppings?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Minced ginger:</strong> When the rich, creamy broth starts feeling heavy, adding this brings a sharp, refreshing kick that cleanses the palate.</li>
<li><strong>Fried onions:</strong> When mixed into the broth, they add a subtle sweetness and nutty richness, plus a satisfying crunch.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>📌</strong> Don't add them from the start — wait until you're <strong>about halfway through</strong>. You'll experience a "second flavor" as the taste shifts from rich to refreshing and layered!</p>

</figure>

<p><strong>Q3. Is it good for solo dining?</strong></p>
<p>A. <strong>Absolutely recommended.</strong> With all seats being counter seats, solo diners can actually feel more comfortable here.</p>

<p><strong>Q4. Is it suitable for kids?</strong></p>
<p>A. While it's possible, it's hard to recommend wholeheartedly. The restaurant is very quiet with only counter seating, making stroller access difficult and there are no high chairs. School-age children and above should be fine.</p>

<p><strong>Q5. Aren't the prices too high?</strong></p>
<p>A. ¥2,000–3,000 per bowl is definitely in the premium tier for Tokyo ramen. But considering the Ginza location, the upscale atmosphere, and the irreplaceable rich broth, it's an experience well worth trying at least once.</p>

## Wrapping Up: More Than Just Ramen

<p>Ginza Kagari is more than just a ramen shop — it's a showcase of Japan's culinary artistry. If you love rich, creamy broth, this could be your life-changing bowl of ramen. That said, if you prefer light, clear broths or dislike long waits, your experience may vary.</p>

<p><strong>📌 Comparison with Iruka Tokyo in Roppongi</strong></p>
<p>If you enjoy Kagari's rich chicken broth and truffle flavors, you'll likely love Iruka Tokyo in Roppongi too. Both hold Michelin Bib Gourmand status and Tabelog Top 100 honors.</p>
<p>While <strong>Kagari specializes in rich, creamy paitan (white broth)</strong>, <strong>Iruka offers clean, deep chintan (clear broth)</strong>. Compare both and find your favorite!</p>

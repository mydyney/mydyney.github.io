<h2>[Course 1] Urban Oasis: Enjoying Ueno Park</h2>

Exit Ueno Station through the Park Exit, and you'll immediately find yourself in the vast green space of Ueno Park. Here, you can choose between two courses based on your interests.

### 🐼 ① Course: For Families - 'Ueno Zoo'

Japan's first zoo, famous for its adorable panda family, is popular with both children and adults. It's quite spacious, so plan plenty of time for your visit.

### 🎨 ② Course: For Art Lovers - 'Museum Tour'

Ueno Park is a "forest of museums." The <strong>National Museum of Western Art</strong>, where you can see Monet's "Water Lilies," and the <strong>Tokyo National Museum</strong>, which houses Japan's national treasures, are among the world-class museums gathered here. Choose one that interests you and enjoy a leisurely visit.

### 🎄 ③ Course (Winter Only): Romantic Christmas Market

If you're visiting Ueno between mid-November and December 25th, don't miss the Ueno Park Christmas Market! Held at Hakama-goshi Square in the center of the park, this market is a must-visit winter date spot in Tokyo, featuring a giant Santa and dazzling illuminations.

Free admission, and we recommend enjoying the park during the day and the market's glühwein in the evening!

<h2>[Course 3] Ueno's Signature Restaurants</h2>

### ① 🦆 Kangnami's Recommendation! Ueno Ramen Restaurant 'Kamotonegi'

<strong>"If you're in Ueno, Ichiran Ramen is good, but the real gem is here!"</strong>

The ramen shop '<strong>[Kamotonegi (鴨to葱)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/mss5mccHhopukq6n8)</strong>', highly praised by the YouTube channel 'Neighborhood Friend Kangnami'. This ramen specialty shop has a unique concept of making broth using only duck (kamo, 鴨) and green onions (negi, 葱), rather than pork or chicken.

- <strong>Recommended Menu</strong>: Kamo Ramen, Kamo Confit Ramen
- Open 24 hours, cash only, expect to wait during meal times

</div>

<strong>✅ Ordering Tips!</strong>

- Kamo Ramen: You can choose 2 out of 3 green onion toppings (grilled onion, white onion salad, green onion).
- Tsukesoba: You can choose sauce spiciness from 0% (default), 30%, or 80%.

{{< figure src="/images/ueno-ameyoko-complete-guide/ueno-ameyoko-guide-15.jpg" alt="Kamotonegi ordering tips" >}}

<strong>✅ How to make it even tastier!</strong>  
Try adding a bit of the <strong>'yuzu kosho'</strong> on the table halfway through. The fragrant flavor adds depth to the taste.

### ② 🐷 Michelin Bib Gourmand Tonkatsu '[Tonpachitei](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ox3CcbHEVayNNRiS6)'

A hidden tonkatsu gem in the back alleys near Ameyoko Market. Thick pork fried at low temperature keeps the juicy meat tender. Be prepared to wait in line at this popular spot.

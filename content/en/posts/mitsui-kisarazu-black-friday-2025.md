Planning a Tokyo trip in November? Here's news you absolutely can't miss: Tokyo Black Friday 2025!

If you could only visit one outlet in Tokyo, I would recommend **Mitsui Outlet Park Kisarazu** without hesitation.

It's much closer to central Tokyo than Gotemba Outlet and offers a wider variety of brands.

Today's post focuses on the 2025 Black Friday sale information and Pokémon Festival event.

*(※ For basic information like transportation (shuttle bus), free luggage storage locations, and discount coupons, please check the 'Complete Guide' link at the top of this post!)*

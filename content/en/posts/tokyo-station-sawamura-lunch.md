## Sawamura Lunch Menu Review

### ① Matsusaka Pork Tandoori Spare Ribs (1,980 yen)
(松阪ポークのタンドリースペアリブ)

<strong>Taste:</strong> Using 'Matsusaka Pork' from Mie Prefecture, famous as one of Japan's top 3 wagyu, the meat quality is surprisingly tender. Touch it with a knife and it slides right off the bone.

<strong>Features:</strong> I worried the tandoori spices might be strong, but the subtle spice aroma only whets your appetite. The savory seasoning pairs perfectly with Sawamura's light bread—I officially recognize this as a "bread thief" menu item.

### ② Crab and Avocado Cream Sauce Tagliatelle (2,288 yen)
(蟹とアボカドのクリームソース タリアテッレ)

<strong>Taste:</strong> The 'forest butter' avocado melts into the cream sauce, exploding with richness. Add the umami of crab meat and it can't help but be delicious.

<strong>Noodles:</strong> Using wide tagliatelle noodles, the sauce clings generously. You must wipe up the remaining sauce with bread! 😋

## 🍞 Bread Lovers' Paradise: Unlimited Bread & Salad

<strong>Unlimited Bread:</strong> Baguette, campagne, nut bread and more come out randomly. The touching detail is they're served warm, not cold. Staff circulate to offer refills.

<strong>Salad:</strong> Not just a token salad, but a fresh, voluminous salad with well-mixed dressing served like a course appetizer.

<strong>Recommended Times:</strong>
- <strong>Open run (11:00):</strong> Shortest wait
- <strong>Late lunch (after 13:30):</strong> Crowd thins out

### 2. Toranomon Hills Branch (Meat/Business)
<strong>Location:</strong> Toranomon Hills Business Tower 2F  
<strong>Features:</strong> Business district location, less crowded

### 3. Nakameguro Branch (Cherry Blossoms/Cafe)
<strong>Location:</strong> 5-minute walk from Nakameguro Station  
<strong>Features:</strong> More casual cafe style for enjoying bread and coffee rather than full meals. Essential during cherry blossom season.

### 4. Hiroo Branch (European Vibes)
<strong>Location:</strong> Hiroo Station (upscale neighborhood with many expats)  
<strong>Features:</strong> 1st floor bakery, 2nd floor restaurant. Exotic and relaxed atmosphere like a European outdoor cafe—best for enjoying brunch and wine.

## 📝 Final Verdict: "Perfect Balance of Value, Taste, and Atmosphere"

<strong>Value:</strong> Early 2,000 yen range gets you brand-name pork, crab pasta, and unlimited bread. Excellent for Tokyo prices.

<strong>Taste:</strong> The bread being delicious is a given, but the main dish quality exceeds expectations.

<strong>Atmosphere:</strong> Shin-Marunouchi Building's unique blend of luxury and energy works for anyone you bring.

If you want a meal near Tokyo Station with no regrets, definitely try the [Spare Ribs + Pasta] combination I had!

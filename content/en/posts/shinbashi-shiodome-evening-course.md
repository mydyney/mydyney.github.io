</figure>

Are you looking for **Shinbashi things to do**? If you want to experience **the real Tokyo nightlife** mixing with salarymen on their way home, rather than glitzy tourist spots, this is the perfect place. From smoky yakitori alleys, the **salaryman's sanctuary**, to the hidden **free observation deck** in neighboring **Shiodome**. Let me introduce you to the perfect evening course to enjoy like a local.

<h2>✨ Salaryman's Sanctuary: Where Past and Future Coexist</h2>

Shinbashi is a **"food and entertainment district"** where tired office workers unwind after a long day. It's filled with lively, down-to-earth energy rather than glamour. Surprisingly, just **5 minutes on foot** from here, you'll find **Shiodome**, a futuristic city of skyscrapers. Experience both the past and future in one visit!

**🚇 How to Get There**: JR Yamanote/Keihin-Tohoku Line, Tokyo Metro Ginza Line, Toei Asakusa Line, Yurikamome → **Shimbashi Station**

<h2>🚶‍♂️ Shinbashi & Shiodome Recommended Evening Course</h2>

Shinbashi is much more attractive at night than during the day. To experience the real nightlife of Tokyo salarymen, visit **after 6 PM** and follow this course.

<h2>[Past] Shinbashi: Peek into the Salaryman's Night</h2>

**1. Meeting Point, <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/5pCQRDW2PtXfLYWw6" target="_blank">SL Plaza (SL広場)</a>**

Exit Shimbashi Station's Hibiya Exit and you'll be greeted by a massive steam locomotive. This is the heart of Shinbashi, where all after-work meetings begin, always filled with waiting salarymen. Take a photo in front of the D51 steam locomotive that operated until 1972 to start your journey.

**2. Pray for Good Fortune, <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/3BWSvHT76dYHqaNk8" target="_blank">Karasumori Shrine (烏森神社)</a>**

A hidden gem of a shrine nestled among skyscrapers. Famous for praying for good fortune and business prosperity, it's also a great photo spot with uniquely colorful torii gates.

**3. Geek Paradise, Tamiya Plamodel Factory**

Known as the "adult's sanctuary," Tamiya's official flagship store is located in Shinbashi. Reopened in May 2024, it features over 6,000 items, life-size mini 4WD cars, and even a cafe with Onibus Coffee (open until 8 PM on weekdays). Perfect for a nostalgic stop before hitting the izakaya!

**4. Smoky Romance, Yakitori & Izakaya Alleys**

This is where Shinbashi's real charm lies. The narrow alleys west of the station filled with yakitori smoke, red lanterns (赤提灯), and lively atmosphere. This is the core of **Shinbashi things to do**. Rather than picking a specific restaurant, explore the alleys at random and dare to enter a place packed with locals - it's likely to be an amazing hidden gem!

**📌 Pro Tip: Shimbashi Station Coin Lockers**

Shimbashi Station has many train lines and can be confusing, but coin lockers are available at major exits. Store your heavy luggage and explore the izakaya alleys comfortably!

- **5 locations in the passage from Shiodome Exit to Ginza Exit**
- **In front of Karasumori Exit after exiting the South Ticket Gate**
- **Passage toward Ginza after exiting the underground Shiodome Ticket Gate**
- **Metro Shimbashi Station**
- **Yurikamome Shimbashi Station**

<h2>[Future] Shiodome: Face the Sparkling Night View</h2>

Just a 5-minute walk through underground passages from Shinbashi's smoky alleys reveals Shiodome, a completely different atmosphere of futuristic skyscrapers. Two must-see free attractions await you here.

**1. Miyazaki Hayao's <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/SnHUpQPdepzFYpsZ7" target="_blank">Nittele Giant Clock</a>**

A giant analog clock reminiscent of "Howl's Moving Castle." Designed by the world-renowned master Miyazaki Hayao himself, it's mounted on the Nippon Television (NTV) building. At scheduled times, 32 mechanical parts come to life for a fantastic 3-minute performance.

- **Performance Times**: Daily at 12:00, 13:00, 15:00, 18:00, 20:00 (10:00 AM show added on weekends)
- **Admission**: Free

**📌 Pro Tip**: Have dinner in Shinbashi and time your visit for the **8 PM show** to see the clock illuminated at night, creating an even more magical sight.

**2. <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/cV5YwV8z5zTEZS1F9" target="_blank">Caretta Shiodome Free Observatory</a>**

The best place to enjoy Shiodome's night beauty. Choose your preferred way to enjoy the night view on the 46th and 47th floors of Caretta Shiodome building.

**Two Ways to Enjoy the Night View**

**✨ Best Value! 46F Free Observation Space**

There's a small free observation space next to the elevator to the restaurant floors. Though compact, the view of **Rainbow Bridge** in Odaiba and **Tokyo Bay** through floor-to-ceiling windows rivals any paid observatory.

</figure>

**🍸 Best Atmosphere! 47F Observation Restaurant & Bar**

For a more leisurely and romantic night view experience, I recommend **<a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/dYHFxA8pCpsH4cTv8" target="_blank">Hibiki (Dynamic Kitchen & Bar 響)</a>** on the 47th floor. Enjoy a special experience with cocktails or meals while gazing at the fantastic night view from window seats. (Window seat reservations recommended)

<h2>📍 After Shinbashi, Where to Go Next? (Recommended Connection Courses)</h2>

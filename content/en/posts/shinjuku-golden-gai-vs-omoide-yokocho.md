## 🍶 2. Omoide Yokocho (Memory Skewer Alley)

The aroma of yakitori (chicken skewers) wafting through narrow alleys,
Tiny 2-pyeong shops with twinkling lights.
This alley preserves Japan's post-war Showa era.

'Omoide Yokocho (思い出横丁)' means 'Memory Alley' in Japanese.
Starting as a black market after World War II, this place still has narrow alleys where
Locals and travelers sit shoulder to shoulder,
Enjoying yakitori (chicken skewers), motsuyaki (giblet skewers), nikomi (stewed dishes)
With a cold beer - a symbolic Shinjuku street.

**✅ Recommended For:**
- Those who want skewers with beer
- Those who enjoy lively, bustling atmosphere
- Solo drinking beginners (can double as 1st stop dinner)

**✅ Tips:**
- **Price**: More expensive than expected. Some places charge otoshi (table charge) - check at entrance.
- **Payment**: Most cash only
- **Restroom**: Shared restroom in alley

Rich soy sauce and charcoal aroma combine to create a restaurant where both locals and foreigners queue.
Signature menu is motsu nikomi (giblet stew).

**💡 Ordering Note!**

This place has no menu.
The owner serves skewers 'omakase' style in order when you sit down,
And you say "Stop!" when you're full for the bill.

- **Order**: Just answer whether you want "with giblets (motsu-iri)" or "without giblets (motsu-nuki)"
- **Dining**: Skewers keep coming. Shout "Stop!" when full.
- **Payment**: System where you only pay for the number of skewers eaten.

💴 Average price: 2,000~3,000 yen
🕓 Waiting required after 5pm / No cards / Cash only

## 4. Essential Tips Before Visiting

**✅ 1. Check Cover Charge**
- **Omoide Yokocho:** Some have 'otoshi (お通し)' basic snack fee
- **Golden Gai:** Most have 500~1,000 yen table charge

**✅ 2. Different Solo Drinking Culture**
- **Omoide Yokocho:** Skewer-focused, good for quiet drinking (difficulty: low)
- **Golden Gai:** Conversation-focused, communication with owner/customers essential (difficulty: high)

**✅ 3. Use Restroom First**

There are many places without restrooms inside Golden Gai.
Cleanliness of shared restrooms varies by shop.

**✅ 4. Local Atmosphere & Exchange Culture (Dating Issue)**

Golden Gai and Omoide Yokocho are places where conversation naturally flows between customers and owners,
And travelers in tight spaces.
Especially Golden Gai has an established culture of greeting each other even during 'solo drinking,'
Or chatting with new people through the bar master.

💬 Some communities (DC, etc.) occasionally mention
'Golden Gai dating' or 'Omoide Yokocho dating,' but
This is **because conversation naturally starts in tight spaces due to Shinjuku's unique atmosphere**.

**📌 Tip:** Enjoy the atmosphere with polite conversation.
Rather than a 'dating street,' this is **Tokyo's nightlife space for enjoying human connection**.

## How to Get There

Miyashita Park is just a 5-minute walk from Shibuya Station. It's also close to the famous Shibuya Scramble Crossing.

Besides Shibuya Station, it's about a 10-minute walk from Harajuku, so you can easily combine both areas in your itinerary. On cold days, taking a taxi from Harajuku costs just the basic fare, making it a convenient option.

## Rooftop Garden

The Miyashita Park rooftop garden illumination creates a fantastic atmosphere with its tunnel design.

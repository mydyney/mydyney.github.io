## 2. Reservation & Entry Guide

<p>The Tokyo Roastery does not accept regular seat reservations, but operates two systems for smooth entry: <strong>advance online booking</strong> and <strong>same-day numbered tickets</strong>.</p>

### ✅ Method 1: Advance Online Time-Slot Booking (Most Recommended)

<p>The smartest way to secure your entry time the day before your visit. (Note: this secures your entry order, not a specific seat.)</p>

<p><strong>① Visit the Registration Page</strong></p>
<p>The day before your visit, access the official registration page (Air Reserve) and select your preferred time slot. (Note: this system is not available every day, so be sure to check the day before!)</p>

<p><strong>② Enter Required Information</strong></p>
<p>Follow the instructions to enter your details, and you'll receive a <strong>confirmation email</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>③ Arrive Within Your Time Slot</strong></p>
<p>Show your confirmation email at the store entrance within your <strong>designated 30-minute time frame</strong> to enter.</p>

<p><i>※ Note: If you arrive later than your designated time, you may be marked as a no-show and denied entry.</i></p>

### ✅ Method 2: Same-Day QR Numbered Ticket & Waiting

<p>This is the on-site waiting system for when you couldn't book in advance or decided to visit spontaneously.</p>

<p><strong>① Ticket Location</strong></p>
<p>Scan the QR code posted on the building to the left of the Starbucks store.</p>

</figure>

<p><strong>② Registration Process</strong></p>
<p>Enter email → Click link in received email → Enter party size → Registration complete!</p>

<p><strong>③ Call Notification</strong></p>
<p>When the waiting status screen changes to <strong>[Called]</strong>, present your number at the store entrance and enter.</p>

<p><strong>📌 February 2026 Local Tips</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Opening rush strategy:</strong> Visiting right at the 7:00 AM opening gives you the highest chance of entering without waiting.</li>
  <li><strong>Early closure warning:</strong> On weekends and peak seasons, same-day tickets may sell out by morning. Be sure to check the Starbucks Reserve Roastery Tokyo <a href="https://x.com/roasterytokyo" target="_blank" rel="noopener" style="color: #667eea; text-decoration: underline;"><strong>official X (Twitter)</strong></a> account for ticket closure announcements before visiting.</li>

## 4. Best Seats & Photo Spots

<p>The Starbucks Reserve Roastery Tokyo is a work of art in itself. Here are the best spots for incredible photos and tips for securing seats. 📸</p>

### ✅ 1. Kengo Kuma's Architectural Aesthetics (1F–4F Interior)

<p>Designed by Japanese architectural master <strong>Kengo Kuma</strong>, this building harmoniously blends traditional Japanese aesthetics with modern sensibility.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Copper Cherry Blossom Ornaments (Copper Cask):</strong> The massive copper pillar spanning from 1F to 4F is decorated with 2,100 copper cherry blossom leaves. It provides a majestic backdrop for photos from any floor.</li>
  <li><strong>Origami Ceiling:</strong> The origami-motif design on the 2F Teavana ceiling, combined with lighting, creates stunning photographs.</li>
</ul>

### ✅ 2. Top Photo Spot: 3F & 4F Outdoor Terrace

<p>Universally acknowledged as having <strong>the most beautiful Starbucks view in all of Tokyo</strong>.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>3F Terrace (Highly Recommended):</strong> The undisputed #1 prime seat offering sweeping views of the Meguro River and the majestic copper cask. The view from this open terrace during cherry blossom season is absolutely breathtaking.</li>
  <li><strong>4F Terrace:</strong> Slightly quieter than the 3F, offering wider panoramic views from above. More spacious, making it better for portrait photos.</li>
</ul>

</figure>

<p><strong>💡 Tips for Securing the Best Seats</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>The opening rush is the answer:</strong> Entering at the 7:00 AM opening dramatically increases your chances of securing a terrace seat.</li>
  <li><strong>Check seats before ordering:</strong> If you're with a group, it's efficient for one person to order while the other heads to the 3rd or 4th floor to scout seats. (However, during busy times, you may need to follow staff directions.)</li>
  <li><strong>Best lighting hours:</strong> Morning to midday, when sunlight is abundant, produces the clearest and most beautiful photos.</li>
</ol>

## 6. Starbucks Reserve Roastery FAQ

<p>We've gathered practical tips for the questions most visitors have before coming. Check them out for a smooth Tokyo trip!</p>

<p><strong>Q1. Are there exclusive goods only available here?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, the tumblers and mugs engraved with the Roastery Tokyo logo are limited editions available only here. Starting from late February, the highly anticipated cherry blossom season goods are released — they're collector's items that sell out quickly, so keep this in mind!</p>

<p><strong>Q2. Where do I order and how do I receive my drinks?</strong></p>
<p>Each floor has a different theme, and the ordering system is well organized.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Where to order:</strong> Order at the dedicated bar on each floor — 1F (coffee/bakery), 2F (tea), 3F (cocktails).</li>
  <li><strong>How to receive:</strong> When the buzzer you received at payment vibrates, pick up your drink at that floor's pickup counter.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Q3. I don't have cash — can I pay by card or mobile payment?</strong></p>
<p>No worries! Major credit cards are accepted, and transit IC cards like Suica and PASMO — travel essentials in Japan — work smoothly and quickly. The mobile tap system makes payment a breeze.</p>

<p><strong>Q4. Is it within walking distance from Nakameguro Station?</strong></p>
<p>It's about a 14-minute walk from Nakameguro Station's west exit. The route follows the beautiful Meguro River, so it doesn't feel tedious — more like a pleasant stroll. However, the walking distance is substantial, so we recommend wearing comfortable shoes.</p>

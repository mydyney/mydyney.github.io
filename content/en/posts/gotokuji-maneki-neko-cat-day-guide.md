## Why Is February 22 Cat Day?

<figure>
  <img src="/images/posts/gotokuji-maneki-neko-cat-day-guide-02.jpg" alt="February 22 Cat Day limited desserts featuring cat paw cakes and Nyan Nyan Day goods">
  <figcaption style="font-size: 0.7em; text-align: center;">February 22 Cat Day limited desserts — cat paw cakes and Nyan Nyan Day goods</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>February 22 is <strong>Japan's Cat Day (Neko no Hi)</strong>.</p>

<p>The Japanese pronunciation of the number 2 — <strong>ni</strong> — sounds similar to the Japanese cat meow <strong>nyan</strong>. Since the number 2 appears three times on <strong>February 22, it became "Nyan Nyan Nyan Day."</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>History:</strong> In 1987, the Japan Pet Food Association officially established this day to celebrate the joy of living with cats.</li>
  <li><strong>Atmosphere:</strong> Every February, convenience stores and department stores across Japan release limited-edition cat-themed desserts and goods, creating a festive atmosphere.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cat-related spending has become such a significant economic phenomenon in Japan that it's even called "Nekonomics" (the cat economy effect).</p>

<p>If you're planning a Tokyo trip around this time, there's one place you absolutely cannot miss — <strong>Gotokuji Temple, the undisputed number one cat destination in Tokyo and the birthplace of maneki-neko.</strong></p>

## What Is Gotokuji Temple?

  <figcaption style="font-size: 0.7em; text-align: center;">Gotokuji Temple's sanmon gate with the Hekiunkan plaque and the pine tree-lined path — a hidden gem in Tokyo</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The formal name is Daikeisan Gotokuji (大谿山 豪徳寺). It is a Soto Zen Buddhist temple located in Setagaya, Tokyo.</p>

<p>As the family temple of the Ii clan — lords of the Hikone domain — Gotokuji is recognized for its well-preserved Edo-period daimyo burial grounds.</p>

<p><strong>Timeline of Gotokuji</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>1480: Founded as Kotokuin (弘徳院)</li>
  <li>1633: Designated as the Ii family's bodaiji (family temple)</li>
  <li>1659: Renamed to "Gotokuji" after Ii Naotaka's posthumous Buddhist name</li>
  <li>2008: Registered as a nationally designated historic site</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>A Peaceful Retreat in the Heart of the City</strong></p>
<p>Despite being located right in the middle of Setagaya, stepping through the temple gate immediately greets you with lush greenery.</p>

<p>The towering pine tree-lined path from the entrance to the sanmon gate and the forest where wild birds flock make this the perfect place to escape the city noise and soak in the tranquil temple atmosphere.</p>

<p><strong>Must-Read Before Your Visit!</strong></p>
<p>The temple office that sells maneki-neko figurines, ema (wish plaques), and charms closes at 3:00 PM. If you only think about the worship closing time and arrive late, you won't be able to bring home a cute cat figurine. We recommend arriving <strong>by 2:30 PM at the latest!</strong></p>

<p>February in Tokyo can be quite chilly in the mornings and evenings. Since Gotokuji has spacious grounds requiring lots of outdoor time, make sure to dress warmly.</p>

## The Legend That Started with One Cat

<p>While returning from a falconry hunt, Lord Ii Naotaka was passing by the temple when a cat beckoned to him.</p>

<p>As soon as he stepped inside the temple grounds, a sudden downpour struck — saving him from a lightning bolt.</p>

<p>The grateful lord rebuilt the temple and enshrined that cat as <strong>Shofukuneko (招福猫児)</strong> — the cat that invites good fortune.</p>

<p>This is the <strong>origin of the maneki-neko</strong>.</p>

## Why Doesn't the Gotokuji Cat Hold a Coin?

<p>The maneki-neko we commonly see holds a gold coin (koban), but the Gotokuji maneki-neko does not hold one.</p>

<p>✔️ Only the right paw is raised</p>
<p>✔️ It beckons not wealth, but "good connections" (en)</p>

<p>The teaching behind this is that completing one's fortune ultimately depends on one's own effort.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="/images/posts/gotokuji-maneki-neko-cat-day-guide-07.jpg" alt="Gotokuji maneki-neko raising right paw without a koban coin, symbolizing beckoning good connections">

<p><strong>2. Three-Story Pagoda — Hidden Cat Hunt</strong></p>
<p>This beautiful wooden pagoda, completed in 2006, stands 22.5 meters tall. Each tier features zodiac animal carvings, and if you look closely, you'll find cats hiding among them — despite not being part of the traditional twelve zodiac animals. The scene where a cat sits peacefully alongside the rat (mouse) zodiac carving is a special sight unique to Gotokuji.</p>

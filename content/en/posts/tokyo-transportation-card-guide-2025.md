## 💳 Why is Getting a Tokyo Transportation Card So Confusing in 2025?

Travelers are confused because issuing policies have changed continuously over the past two years.

- **2023:** Regular Suica and PASMO physical card issuance was completely suspended due to semiconductor shortages.
- **2024:** Even the tourist-specific "PASMO Passport" (Sanrio card) alternative was discontinued.
- **2025 Current:** New physical cards for travelers—"Welcome Suica" and "PASMO"—are now available.

Let me clarify this complex situation for your specific needs!

## ✅ Which Card is Right for Me? (Super Simple Selection Guide)

Confused? Just answer two questions.

**Question 1. Do you have an iPhone?**
⭕️ Yes (iPhone user) ➡️ **Answer Question 2!**
❌ No (Android user) ➡️ **Go to [Guide B]!**

**Question 2. Do you use Apple Pay?**
⭕️ Yes (Apple Pay + iPhone) ➡️ **Go to [Guide A]!**
❌ No (No Hyundai Card) ➡️ **Go to [Guide B]!**

## [Guide A] iPhone + Apple Pay Users 📱 'Mobile Transportation Card'

If you have an iPhone and use Apple Pay, you're eligible for the most convenient "mobile transportation card"!

- **Unbeatable Convenience:** Solve everything with your phone/Apple Watch without a physical card!
- **Cost Savings:** No 500 yen deposit required for physical cards.
- **Permanent Use:** No expiration limits like 28 days—use it on your next trip too.
- **Easy Charging:** Top up anytime, anywhere with credit card—no cash needed.

**📌 Suica vs PASMO?**
For mobile cards, Suica and PASMO have 100% identical functions. Get whichever you see first—there's absolutely no difference.

### 📱 Super Easy! How to Get iPhone Suica/PASMO

*(※ No need to download separate 'Suica' or 'PASMO' apps—issuing via iPhone's built-in 'Wallet' app is fastest.)*

1. Open iPhone **'Wallet'** app.
2. Tap **'+'** button in top right and select **'Transit Card'**.
3. Choose **'Suica'** or **'PASMO'** from the Japan list.
4. Select charge amount (from 1,000 yen).
5. Pay with Apple Pay's **'Hyundai Card'** and issuance completes instantly!

**✅ Charging Method 1. Apple Pay Charging (Hyundai Card Required)**
Currently, **'Hyundai Card'** is the only card that can be registered with Apple Pay in Korea. Therefore, to issue and charge mobile Suica/PASMO with credit card, you need **Hyundai Card registered with Apple Pay**.

**✅ Charging Method 2. Cash Charging (Solution When You Don't Have Hyundai Card)**
If you don't have a Hyundai Card, you can add Suica/PASMO to your Wallet app and **charge with cash at JR stations, subway stations, or airport ticket machines**! (Thanks to HuchuUnni for this tip🙏)

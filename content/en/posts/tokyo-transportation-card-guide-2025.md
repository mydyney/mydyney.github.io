## 💳 Why is Getting a Tokyo Transportation Card So Confusing in 2025?

Travelers are confused because issuing policies have changed continuously over the past two years.

- <strong>2023:</strong> Regular Suica and PASMO physical card issuance was completely suspended due to semiconductor shortages.
- <strong>2024:</strong> Even the tourist-specific "PASMO Passport" (Sanrio card) alternative was discontinued.
- <strong>2025 Current:</strong> New physical cards for travelers—"Welcome Suica" and "PASMO"—are now available.

Let me clarify this complex situation for your specific needs!

## ✅ Which Card is Right for Me? (Super Simple Selection Guide)

Confused? Just answer two questions.

<strong>Question 1. Do you have an iPhone?</strong>
⭕️ Yes (iPhone user) ➡️ <strong>Answer Question 2!</strong>
❌ No (Android user) ➡️ <strong>Go to [Guide B]!</strong>

<strong>Question 2. Do you use Apple Pay?</strong>
⭕️ Yes (Apple Pay + iPhone) ➡️ <strong>Go to [Guide A]!</strong>
❌ No (No Hyundai Card) ➡️ <strong>Go to [Guide B]!</strong>

## [Guide A] iPhone + Apple Pay Users 📱 'Mobile Transportation Card'

If you have an iPhone and use Apple Pay, you're eligible for the most convenient "mobile transportation card"!

- <strong>Unbeatable Convenience:</strong> Solve everything with your phone/Apple Watch without a physical card!
- <strong>Cost Savings:</strong> No 500 yen deposit required for physical cards.
- <strong>Permanent Use:</strong> No expiration limits like 28 days—use it on your next trip too.
- <strong>Easy Charging:</strong> Top up anytime, anywhere with credit card—no cash needed.

<strong>📌 Suica vs PASMO?</strong>

### 📱 Super Easy! How to Get iPhone Suica/PASMO

*(※ No need to download separate 'Suica' or 'PASMO' apps—issuing via iPhone's built-in 'Wallet' app is fastest.)*

1. Open iPhone <strong>'Wallet'</strong> app.
2. Tap <strong>'+'</strong> button in top right and select <strong>'Transit Card'</strong>.
3. Choose <strong>'Suica'</strong> or <strong>'PASMO'</strong> from the Japan list.
4. Select charge amount (from 1,000 yen).
5. Pay with Apple Pay's <strong>'Hyundai Card'</strong> and issuance completes instantly!

<strong>✅ Charging Method 1. Apple Pay Charging (Hyundai Card Required)</strong>
Currently, <strong>'Hyundai Card'</strong> is the only card that can be registered with Apple Pay in Korea. Therefore, to issue and charge mobile Suica/PASMO with credit card, you need <strong>Hyundai Card registered with Apple Pay</strong>.

<strong>✅ Charging Method 2. Cash Charging (Solution When You Don't Have Hyundai Card)</strong>
If you don't have a Hyundai Card, you can add Suica/PASMO to your Wallet app and <strong>charge with cash at JR stations, subway stations, or airport ticket machines</strong>! (Thanks to HuchuUnni for this tip🙏)

## [Guide B] Android/No Apple Pay Users 'Physical Transportation Card'

If you're an Android user (Samsung Pay, etc.) or iPhone user without Apple Pay (Hyundai Card), you'll need to get a physical transportation card.

As of 2025, physical cards available to travelers are <strong>'Welcome Suica'</strong> and <strong>'PASMO'</strong>. These cards have completely different characteristics, so check the table below and choose the right card for you!

<div class="info-box">

      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Validity Period</td>
        <td>28 days (short-term travel only)</td>

        <td>Cash only</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

### 🚨 Final Verdict: Choose the Card That Fits Your Style!

<strong>1. Welcome Suica - 'Convenience' Priority</strong>
- "Don't want to wait in refund lines at the airport on my last day!"
- "I'll spend leftover yen at convenience stores as souvenirs!"
- "Don't want to withdraw cash—want to issue easily with credit card!"

👍 For these travelers, we recommend the red cherry blossom design <strong>'Welcome Suica'</strong>.

<strong>2. PASMO - 'Economic Value' Priority</strong>

- "Might visit Japan again later! (10-year validity)"
- "Using cash for issuance isn't inconvenient!"

👍 For these travelers, we recommend <strong>'PASMO'</strong>.

## 💡 Do I Need a Transit Card If I Bought a Subway Pass?

Yes, these two cards have completely different roles! Using both together is the most economical combination.

<strong>1. Suica/PASMO (T-money Card)</strong>
- <strong>Role:</strong> Rechargeable multi-purpose card
- <strong>Usage:</strong> ⭕️ JR, ⭕️ Subway, ⭕️ Buses, ⭕️ Convenience stores/vending machines
- This is your <strong>'transportation wallet'</strong> that works everywhere in Tokyo.

<strong>2. Tokyo Subway Ticket (Unlimited Subway Pass)</strong>
- <strong>Role:</strong> Unlimited subway ticket
- <strong>Usage:</strong> ⭕️ Subway (24/48/72 hours)
- ❌ <strong>Cannot use on JR, buses, or at convenience stores!</strong>

  <figcaption style="font-size: 0.7em; text-align: center;"><strong>Tokyo unlimited subway pass / Tokyo Subway Ticket (24/48/72-hour passes)</strong></figcaption>
</figure>

### 🚨 Conclusion: 'Subway Pass + Suica' Combination is the Answer!

If your travel itinerary includes <strong>3-4+ subway rides per day</strong>, use <strong>'Tokyo Subway Ticket'</strong> to save on transportation costs.

Then use <strong>'Suica (or PASMO)'</strong> for <strong>JR lines not covered by subway pass</strong> or when <strong>buying drinks at convenience stores</strong>—this is the smartest combination!

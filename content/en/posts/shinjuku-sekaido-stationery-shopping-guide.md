## 🚨 Tax-Free vs Membership Discount (Must Read!)

SEKAIDO has a **membership card system with up to 30% discount**.

  <img src="/images/posts/shinjuku-sekaido-stationery-shopping-guide-03.jpg" alt="SEKAIDO membership card discount price table">
  <figcaption>SEKAIDO Membership Card Discount Price Table</figcaption>
</figure>

### 1. Membership Card Fee (Paid)

Membership card registration fee is **500 yen (cash only)**, valid for 2 years.

### 2. Cash Payment Only for Discounts

All membership benefits (discounts, points) are **only applicable with cash payment**.

### 3. Cannot Combine with Tax-Free

You cannot receive both **'tax-free (10%)'** and **'membership benefits (discount + points)'**. You must choose one.

---

## 💡 Situation 1: Credit Card Payment (Purchase over 5,500 yen)

No need to think - **always choose tax-free (10% discount)**.

Membership benefits are only available with cash payment, so there are no benefits with card payment.

**✅ Credit card payment: Tax-free without question!**

---

## 💡 Situation 2: Cash Payment Under 5,500 Yen (Below Tax-Free Threshold)

In this case, 'tax-free' option is not available. You need to calculate whether paying the 500 yen membership fee for the discount is worthwhile.

**✅ Cash 2,500 yen or more but under 5,500 yen: Membership is beneficial!**

---

## 💡 Situation 3: Cash Payment Over 5,500 Yen (Most Important!)
### (Tax-Free 10% vs Membership 500 yen + 20~30% Discount)

For most stationery/manga supplies (20% discount), with 5,500 yen purchase:
- Tax-free gives approximately 550 yen discount
- Membership gives 1,100 yen (20%) discount even after paying 500 yen fee - much more beneficial

For oil paints (30% discount), the difference is even greater. In this case, membership is always beneficial.

**✅ For cash purchases over 5,500 yen: Membership is always more beneficial even after paying the 500 yen fee!**

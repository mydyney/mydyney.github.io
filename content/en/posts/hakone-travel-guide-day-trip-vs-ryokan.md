## Hakone Travel Course Recommendations for Your Style

We propose two customized courses to make 200% use of your Hakone Free Pass.

## Course 1: Perfect Hakone Day Trip (Core Conquest Course)

The essential course for busy travelers. Starting early in the morning is key!

<strong>1. Shinjuku → Hakone-Yumoto: Relax on the Romancecar (approx. 80 min)</strong>

Depart from Tokyo on the Romancecar. It's a direct limited express to Hakone-Yumoto Station (OH51) with no transfers. The journey takes about an hour and a half. All seats are reserved so you can enjoy the scenery comfortably. On clear days, you can even see Mt. Fuji through the window, building excitement for your trip! The right window seats offer the best Fuji views.

</div>

<strong>2. Hakone-Yumoto → Gora: The Mountain Railway Experience!</strong>

Take the Hakone Tozan Train from Hakone-Yumoto (OH51) up to Gora (OH57) at 541m elevation. This mountain railway zigzags up the steep slopes using switchbacks. The conductor changes cabins at each switchback! The view from the front (or back) seat is spectacular.

</figure>

<strong>3. Gora → Sounzan: Cable Car & Footbath with a View</strong>

Transfer to the Hakone Tozan Cable Car at Gora Station (OH57). The classic cable car rattles up the steep incline. If you sit at the very back, you can see the two cable cars passing each other narrowly.

At Sounzan Station, take a break at the <strong>"cu-mo Hakone"</strong> observation deck. There is a free footbath where you can soak your feet while gazing at the stunning mountain view.

</div>

<strong>4. Sounzan → Owakudani: Ropeway over the Volcano!</strong>

Board the Hakone Ropeway. As you crest the mountain, the majestic Mt. Fuji often appears in front of you (weather permitting)! Look down to see the "Hell Valley" (Jigokudani) of Owakudani, with sulfurous fumes rising from the active volcanic vents.

<figure>

</figure>

<strong>Owakudani (大涌谷)</strong>

The smell of sulfur fills the air. This active volcanic zone feels like another planet.

<strong>Must-Eat: Black Eggs (Kuro-tamago)</strong>

These eggs are boiled in the hot sulfurous mud ponds. The shells turn black due to a chemical reaction. Legend says eating one adds 7 years to your life!

<strong>6. Lake Ashi Pirate Ship (Sightseeing Cruise)</strong>

From Togendai Port, board the famous Hakone Pirate Ship. It traverses the calm waters of Lake Ashi (an ancient caldera lake). The cruise takes about 25-40 minutes to Hakone-machi or Moto-Hakone ports.

</figure>

<strong>7. Hakone Shrine & Heiwa no Torii</strong>

After arriving at Moto-Hakone Port, walk along the lake to the Hakone Shrine. The massive cedar trees create a mystical atmosphere. From the shrine, you can walk about 10 minutes to Lake Ashi to see the 1260-year-old shrine's history. The people who come from afar to visit Hakone Shrine and the torii gate are endless. It's crowded with worshippers and photographers, and there's always a line.

</figure>

<strong>8. Moto-Hakone → Hakone-Yumoto → Shinjuku: Return via Tozan Bus then depart for Shinjuku</strong>

Take the Hakone Tozan Bus (K, R, H routes) to Hakone-Yumoto Station (OH51). From Moto-Hakone to Hakone-Yumoto takes about 40 minutes.

Even if you didn't pre-book the Romancecar, you can purchase limited express tickets at Hakone-Yumoto Station.

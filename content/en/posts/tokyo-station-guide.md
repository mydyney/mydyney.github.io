## Essential Tip for Travelers: Tokyo Station Luggage Storage (Coin Lockers)

Before enjoying the attractions of Tokyo Station, you'll want to get rid of your heavy luggage, right? <strong>Tokyo Station luggage storage</strong> is easy thanks to Japan's largest scale coin locker facilities.

<strong>Location:</strong> Coin lockers are installed in a total of 43 locations: 13 inside the ticket gates and 30 outside.

<strong>Caution:</strong> Since the station is very large and there are many lockers, it is highly recommended to <strong>take a photo of the location</strong> where you stored your bags. Be aware that coin lockers outside the Yaesu side ticket gates are managed by different entities, so the numbering system can be complicated.

## 🏮 Shibuya Izakaya Alley's Boss: Toritake

Located right next to Mark City in central Shibuya, <strong>Toritake (鳥竹)</strong> has been operating for over 60 years. It is not just another chicken joint — it is a Shibuya institution.

<p>Three things set this place apart:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Showa-era ambiance:</strong> Forget trendy interiors. This is an authentic, bustling old-school Japanese establishment — the kind locals call a "shinise" (老舗). Smoke, noise, and neon signs included.</li>
  <li><strong>Overwhelming skewer size:</strong> Toritake is famous for its "ookushi" (大串) — large skewers roughly 1.5 times bigger than the standard size. Just one or two of these is enough to fill you up.</li>
  <li><strong>Daytime drinking paradise:</strong> The shop opens at noon, and by early afternoon it is already packed with locals enjoying lunch beers and yakitori. A true "hirunomi" (daytime drinking) haven.</li>
</ul>

<p>The building spans from B1 to 2F with 128 total seats, but during dinner peak hours every floor is packed. The seats are narrow and close together — that is the authentic retro charm.</p>

## 📞 Reservation Conditions & Waiting Tips

<p>Reservations at Toritake come with strict conditions:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Group size:</strong> 5 or more people only</li>
  <li><strong>Time:</strong> Must enter before 7:00 PM</li>
  <li><strong>Limit:</strong> 2-hour time limit</li>
  <li><strong>Method:</strong> Phone reservation only (03-3461-1627)</li>
</ul>

<p>For groups of 2–4 travelers, <strong>reservations are not possible</strong> — you will need to wait on-site. The good news is that turnover is fast since most customers are just having a few skewers and drinks.</p>

<p><strong>Our strong recommendation:</strong> arrive before 6:00 PM, or better yet, take advantage of Toritake's noon opening and go for a daytime drinking session. The 3:00–4:00 PM window is another sweet spot to walk right in without any wait.</p>

## 📝 Top 3 Must-Try Menus

<p>Toritake's skewers are much bigger than what you will find at typical yakitori shops — these are the famous "daikushi" (大串), oversized skewers that are the restaurant's trademark. Good news for international visitors: an <strong>English language menu</strong> is available!</p>

### 1. Yakitori Don (やき鳥丼)

<p>This is the absolute must-order during lunch hours (served until around 2:00 PM). A giant charcoal-grilled chicken skewer, green pepper, and liver are placed on top of rice, all drenched in Toritake's 60-year-old secret tare sauce. It is a "rice thief" — the kind of dish that makes you shovel rice uncontrollably.</p>

<p><strong>Ordering tip:</strong> When you order the yakitori don, the staff will ask whether you want liver included. Here is what to say:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Remove liver:</strong> "Reba nuki de onegaishimasu" (レバ抜きでお願いします)</li>
  <li><strong>Include liver:</strong> "Reba irete kudasai" (レバ入れてください)</li>
</ul>

</figure>

### 2. Large Skewer Yakitori (大串やきとり)

<p>Crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside — that is the magic of charcoal-grilled ookushi. If you already ordered the yakitori don (which comes with tare sauce), try the skewers with salt for a nice flavor contrast.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Salt:</strong> "Shio de onegaishimasu" (塩でお願いします)</li>
  <li><strong>Sauce:</strong> "Tare de onegaishimasu" (タレでお願いします)</li>
</ul>

</figure>

### 3. Piman Tsukune (ピーマンつくね)

<p>Fans of "Kodoku no Gourmet" (Solitary Gourmet) will recognize this one. A juicy minced chicken meatball is stuffed inside a crunchy, slightly bitter bell pepper — the texture contrast between the tender tsukune and the crisp piman is addictive.</p>

## 🥡 Takeout (Hotel Late-Night Snack Recommendation)

<p>If the wait is too long, Toritake's takeout is an excellent alternative. Grab some skewers and enjoy them back at the hotel with a cold beer from the convenience store — honestly, one of the simple joys of traveling in Tokyo.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Large skewers:</strong> ¥333 – ¥383 each</li>
  <li><strong>Bento boxes:</strong> ¥1,080 – ¥1,400</li>
  <li><strong>Omakase set:</strong> 6 pieces (¥2,000) / 10 pieces (¥3,300)</li>
</ul>

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions (Q&A)

<p><strong>Q. Can I go alone?</strong></p>
<p>A. Absolutely! The 1F counter and standing seats are a solo diner's paradise. It is a casual izakaya — no one will give you a second look for eating alone. Grab a seat, order a beer and a couple of skewers, and enjoy.</p>

<p><strong>Q. Can I bring children?</strong></p>
<p>A. Yes. Since Toritake is now fully non-smoking, children are welcome. That said, the atmosphere is very much a lively izakaya — expect noise, narrow seating, and bustling energy. Despite the restaurant being over 60 years old, the 2F seating was comfortable enough for a relaxed meal.</p>

<p><strong>Q. How long is the wait?</strong></p>
<p>A. During weekday evening peak hours, expect a minimum 30-minute wait. Since there is no break time (open continuously from noon to 11 PM), going right after opening or during the 3:00–4:00 PM lull lets you walk in immediately.</p>

## 🍻 Final Thoughts

<p>Toritake is about as fail-proof as it gets for Shibuya yakitori. It brings together taste, atmosphere, and value in a way that few other places can match. If you want a lively, human, unmistakably Tokyo kind of night — the kind where smoke hangs in the air and conversation fills every corner — this is the spot.</p>

<p>How about a big skewer with a cold draft beer tonight?</p>

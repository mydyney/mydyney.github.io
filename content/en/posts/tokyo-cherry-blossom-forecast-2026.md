### 2️⃣ What Are the Official Forecast Sources?

This information is based on official forecast data from two sources: Weathernews and Japan Meteorological Corporation (JMC).

> **⚠️ Note:** The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) only provides actual cherry blossom observation results and has **not published forecast maps since 2010**. Therefore, citing official data from private meteorological agencies is the most accurate approach.

## 🌸 When is Peak Bloom? Optimal 2026 Tokyo Cherry Blossom Travel Timing

What really matters for travelers isn't "blooming" (a few flowers) but **peak bloom (when photos look best)**.

### 1️⃣ When Are Tokyo Cherry Blossoms Most Beautiful? (Peak Bloom)

For Tokyo, cherry blossoms reach their peak about 7 days after blooming. Based on JMC data analysis, the **optimal cherry blossom viewing period** is:

- **📸 Peak Bloom (Best for Photos): Around March 29 (Sunday)**
- **📉 Cherry Blossom Finale (Petal Shower): April 1 (Wednesday) ~ April 5 (Sunday)**

During this period, petals flutter in the wind, creating the most atmospheric photos and videos.

</figure>

### 2️⃣ If I Go in Early April, Will All the Blossoms Have Fallen?

"I booked my flight late—will everything be gone by early April?" The short answer: you can still see them.

- **March 29 (Sunday) ~ 31 (Tuesday): ★Best!** Dense pink cherry blossom tunnels blocking out the sky
- **April 1 (Wednesday) ~ 5 (Sunday):** Petals fluttering in the wind creating **'Sakura Fubuki'** (cherry blossom blizzard) season. (The carpet of petals on the ground is spectacular)
- **After April 6 (Monday):** Green leaves start appearing. At this point, head to **Shinjuku Gyoen's double-flowered cherry blossoms (Yaezakura)**!

### 2️⃣ March Clothing Tips

**1. Temperature is Spring, Wind is Winter**  
While Tokyo has higher temperatures, **wind speed (23km/h)** is strong. Especially riverside areas like Nakameguro feel much colder.  
👉 **Wind-blocking trench coats** or **leather jackets** are essential.

**2. Knitwear During Day, Padding at Night**  
During the day (13°C), capture Instagram-worthy shots in a trench coat, but for evenings (3°C), pack a **lightweight padded vest** or **scarf** to wear under your coat. After sunset, it's as cold as early March in Seoul.

## 1. Golden Gai Legend, Moved to Shinjuku-Sanchome!

'Epitaph Curry' was originally a legendary late-night restaurant that only opened at night in Shinjuku's Golden Gai.

However, in May 2020, it officially moved near Shinjuku-sanchome Station (2nd Sigma Building B1F) and now opens during the day too!

  <figcaption style="font-size: 0.7em; text-align: center;">Shinjuku-sanchome Shinjuku curry restaurant Epitaph Curry storefront entrance view</figcaption>
</figure>

Now you can taste the legendary curry in a comfortable 12-seat counter restaurant instead of a cramped bar.

Of course, its reputation as a Tabelog top 100 restaurant (3.76 rating) remains intact. It's one of the hottest <strong>Shinjuku curry restaurants</strong> in Tokyo.

</div>

However, this menu doesn't have the curry names written on it.

The most important information is on the top line!

"Please choose from 3 types of curry on the blackboard inside the store."
カレーは店内黒板の3種類よりお選びください

In other words, you have to look at the blackboard inside the store to see 'today's curry'!

## 3. 👑 Shinjuku Keema Curry King: Menu Review

The menu is 3 types of curry that change daily, and I chose the <strong>2-type aigake (half-and-half curry)</strong> to taste both.

<strong>Pork Vindaloo (ポークビンダルー)</strong> is not Japanese roux curry but a <strong>spice curry</strong> with intense spices. <strong>It's a flavor explosion of strong sourness, umami, and spiciness.</strong>

<strong>Keema</strong> means <strong>minced meat</strong> in Hindi or Urdu.

<strong>Keema curry</strong>, unlike the chunk meat curry we know, is minced meat (usually pork or beef) stir-fried with onions, tomatoes, and spices into a <strong>dry curry without broth</strong>.

The sauce isn't saucy, and the minced meat is seasoned moderately, making it perfect for mixing over rice.

For a Shinjuku restaurant tour, instead of the tonkatsu and udon curry everyone goes to,

if you want to experience special <strong>Shinjuku curry flavor</strong>,

I strongly recommend Tabelog-recognized Shinjuku keema curry <strong>'Epitaph Curry'</strong>.

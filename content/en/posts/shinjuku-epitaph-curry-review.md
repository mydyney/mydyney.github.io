## 1. Golden Gai Legend, Moved to Shinjuku-Sanchome!

'Epitaph Curry' was originally a legendary late-night restaurant that only opened at night in Shinjuku's Golden Gai.

However, in May 2020, it officially moved near Shinjuku-sanchome Station (2nd Sigma Building B1F) and now opens during the day too!

  <figcaption style="font-size: 0.7em; text-align: center;">Shinjuku-sanchome Shinjuku curry restaurant Epitaph Curry storefront entrance view</figcaption>
</figure>

Now you can taste the legendary curry in a comfortable 12-seat counter restaurant instead of a cramped bar.

Of course, its reputation as a Tabelog top 100 restaurant (3.76 rating) remains intact. It's one of the hottest **Shinjuku curry restaurants** in Tokyo.

</figure>

However, this menu doesn't have the curry names written on it.

The most important information is on the top line!

"Please choose from 3 types of curry on the blackboard inside the store."
カレーは店内黒板の3種類よりお選びください

In other words, you have to look at the blackboard inside the store to see 'today's curry'!

## 3. 👑 Shinjuku Keema Curry King: Menu Review

The menu is 3 types of curry that change daily, and I chose the **2-type aigake (half-and-half curry)** to taste both.

<figure>

  <figcaption style="font-size: 0.7em; text-align: center;">Epitaph 2-type aigake curry with minced pork burdock keema curry and pumpkin coconut curry</figcaption>
</figure>

**Pork Vindaloo (ポークビンダルー)** is not Japanese roux curry but a **spice curry** with intense spices. **It's a flavor explosion of strong sourness, umami, and spiciness.**

**Keema** means **minced meat** in Hindi or Urdu.

**Keema curry**, unlike the chunk meat curry we know, is minced meat (usually pork or beef) stir-fried with onions, tomatoes, and spices into a **dry curry without broth**.

The sauce isn't saucy, and the minced meat is seasoned moderately, making it perfect for mixing over rice.

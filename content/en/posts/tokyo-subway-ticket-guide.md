Are you wondering where to exchange your **Tokyo Subway Ticket** after purchasing it? This guide covers everything you need to know for 2025, from latest exchange locations to the cheapest way to buy, how to use it, and available routes. Find the perfect pass for your trip among the 24, 48, and 72-hour options.

<br>

### 📌 Note: The Subway Pass alone isn't enough!
While the **Tokyo Subway Ticket** offers unlimited rides on the subway, it **cannot be used for JR lines, buses, or payments at convenience stores**. It is highly recommended to also have a **prepaid IC card (Suica or PASMO)** for seamless travel. Check out our comprehensive guide on issuing Suica on iPhone below!

## 1. Pricing & Types: Which one is best for you?

The Tokyo Subway Ticket is available in three types. Choose the one that fits your travel duration and style.

## 2. How to Buy: Where is the cheapest?

While you can purchase the ticket on-site, it is generally much cheaper and more convenient to buy in advance through global travel platforms like **Klook** or **KKday**.

## 3. Exchange Locations & Method (Crucial! ⭐)

Here is a step-by-step guide with photos on how to exchange your QR code for a physical ticket. (**Note: QR code exchange is NOT available at airport ticket machines!**)

<br>

### 🚆 Major Subway Stations with Exchange Locations
You can exchange your ticket at the **ticket vending machines** located in most major hub stations like Tokyo, Shibuya, Shinjuku, Oshiage, Ueno, Daimon, and Sengakuji.

<br>

### 🚆 How to Use the Ticket Vending Machine

**Step 1: Look for a machine with the "QR code" mark on the top right.**

## 4. Usage & Available Lines

*   **How to Use**: Simply insert your physical ticket into the ticket gate's slot, pass through, and don't forget to take the ticket as it pops out from the other side. You can use it as many times as you want within the validity period.
*   **Available Lines**: **All lines of Tokyo Metro + Toei Subway (13 lines in total)**

🚨 **Important: JR lines (like the Yamanote Line) and other private railways are NOT included!**

If your itinerary involves many JR lines (Shinjuku, Harajuku, Shibuya, Akihabara, etc.), the Tokyo Subway Ticket might not be the best value for you. In that case, which pass should you choose?

## 5. First Use Station after Arriving at the Airport

This is one of the most common points of confusion! The Tokyo Subway Ticket cannot be used on airport express trains (JR Narita Express, Keisei Skyliner, etc.). You can start using it from your **first transfer station** in the city, as listed below:

<div class="table-container">

| Airport | Transportation | Subway Pass Start Station |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Narita Airport** | Narita Express (N'EX) | Tokyo, Shibuya, Shinjuku |
| | Keisei Skyliner | Ueno Station |
| | Access Express | Oshiage Station (Skytree) |
| **Haneda Airport** | Tokyo Monorail | Hamamatsucho → Daimon Station |
| | Keikyu Line | Sengakuji Station |

</div>

**📌 Pro Tip:** Plan your trip in advance by considering your accommodation's location and which airport train connects best to the subway network. For example, if you are staying near Oshiage, the Access Express is the best choice.

<br>

## 6. Save More! Bundle Tickets

You can save even more by purchasing the Tokyo Subway Ticket in a bundle with other transportation or attraction tickets.

### 🚇 Keisei Skyliner + Tokyo Subway Ticket
Highly recommended for Narita Airport users. It is much cheaper than buying them separately.

➡️ [**Get the Skyliner + Tokyo Subway Ticket Bundle at the Lowest Price on Klook**](https://affiliate.klook.com/redirect?aid=89176&aff_adid=1135033&k_site=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.klook.com%2Fko%2Factivity%2F1552-subway-ticket-tokyo%2F)

<div class="table-container">

| Bundle Type | Regular Price | Discount Price |
| :--- | :---: | :---: |
| Skyliner (One-way) + 24-Hour | ¥3,380 | **¥2,900** |
| Skyliner (One-way) + 48-Hour | ¥3,780 | **¥3,300** |
| Skyliner (One-way) + 72-Hour | ¥4,080 | **¥3,600** |

The entrance display features unique local specialties from Japan. In autumn, there are many cookies and pies made with chestnuts and sweet potatoes.

There is also a wide variety of Bento boxes. When the weather is nice, it's great to buy a bento and eat it at a nearby park in Roppongi Hills. There is a microwave next to the counter, so you can warm it up. It is crowded with office workers buying lunch during the day.

### ✅ Recommendation 1: Local Specialty Snacks

This corner features traditional snacks made from specialties of various Japanese regions. From gift sets with various packages to bag snacks, there is a wide variety. I bought sweet potato stick snacks from the Kyushu region, and the sweet taste was unstoppable!

## 3. 1F: Sake, Wine & Alcohol Heaven 🍷

As a supermarket that started as a liquor specialty store, it has a wide range of alcohol from Japanese sake to beer, wine, and whiskey.

### ✅ Recommendation 2: Dassai Sake

**Dassai (獺祭)**, the most convincing sake in Japan, is available by type and size, making it a great gift. The number on Dassai refers to the rice polishing ratio; the more the rice is polished, the more expensive it is (Dassai 23 > 39 > 45/50).

<div class="image-group-2">

  </figure>
</div>

> [!TIP]
> **Duty-Free Tip:**
> Since the duty-free limit for alcohol entering Korea allows up to 2L without bottle count limits (from Mar 2025), you can buy up to 11 bottles of small 180ml Dassai duty-free! Perfect for gifts.

If you are curious about the official prices of the entire Dassai lineup in Japan, check the article below.

"Junmai Shibanoya" featuring a Shiba Inu illustration is a Junmai sake with good cost-performance produced by Endo Brewery in Suzaka City, Nagano Prefecture. It is popular as a gift due to its cute design.

In the refrigerator, various beers ranging from world beers to Japanese local craft beers are packed. Japanese beer cans have various designs, so they are also popular for collection.

There are also whiskeys collaborated with popular manga like "Drops of God" and "Attack on Titan". Maybe because it's a limited edition label, the price is... enormous.

The wine corner is also well-equipped from world wines to Japanese wines. White wine produced from **Koshu (甲州)**, a Japanese indigenous grape variety, pairs well with Japanese seafood dishes.

They also sell **Château Mont-Pérat**, a Bordeaux wine that the protagonist in "Drops of God" compared to Queen's "Bohemian Rhapsody". It is loved in Korea as a cost-effective wine with great quality.

Currently, the #1 selling wine at Shinanoya Roppongi Hills is the Chilean **"Villa Golf"**. Villa Golf is a wine loved by golf enthusiasts because it uses golf scoring for its grading system (Albatross Gran Reserva > Eagle Reserva > Hole in One > Birdie). It would be a great gift for those who love golf! ⛳

</figure>

For those who can't drink alcohol, I recommend **"Dolce Pop Lemonade"**. It uses 10% lemon juice from Sicily, Italy, creating a harmony of freshness and sweetness. It's good cold or warm and goes well with Japanese food.

## 4. 2F: Fresh Foods & Seasonings 🥦

Take the escalator up to the 2nd floor. The 2nd floor sells fresh and processed foods.

Vegetables, fruits, meat, fish - there are really various ingredients. Although you cannot bring them back home from overseas travel, it is fun to look around. Especially the fish corner is full of fish and ingredients I've never seen before.

One bottle of 180ml Dassai sold on the 1st floor and a pack of assorted sashimi would make a happy dinner for 20,000 won (approx. 2,000 yen).

### ✅ Recommendation 3: Variety of Seasonings & Sushi Soy Sauce

Japanese cuisine calls "Umami" the fifth taste and has developed various seasonings to bring it out. Soy sauce, miso, and vinegar have different colors and tastes depending on the region.

    <img src="/images/posts/shinanoya-roppongi-hills-supermarket-34.jpg" alt="Various Soy Sauces 1">
  </figure>
</div>

The variety of soy sauces produced by region is amazing. Major brands like **Kikkoman, Yamasa, Higashimaru**, as well as local soy sauces. The Kansai region prefers light-colored soy sauce, while the Kanto region prefers dark-colored soy sauce.

<div class="image-group-2">

  <figure>
    <img src="/images/posts/shinanoya-roppongi-hills-supermarket-36.jpg" alt="Various Soy Sauces 3">
  </figure>
</div>

Among them, I looked for **Sushi Soy Sauce**. Sushi soy sauce is less salty than regular soy sauce and adds umami and sweetness with kelp and bonito flakes. There are two types: slightly thin and thick.

In Shinanoya, you can buy **Akazu (Red Vinegar) Soy Sauce** made in the traditional way. Akazu soy sauce uses red vinegar made by aging sake lees from 100% rice for 3 years. It has a deep taste and mild acidity, so it is used in high-end sushi restaurants. With a 150ml capacity, it's not bulky and the price is reasonable, so it's good for a gift.

    <img src="/images/posts/shinanoya-roppongi-hills-supermarket-38.jpg" alt="Sushi Soy Sauce 2">
  </figure>
</div>

There is also **Yuzu Kosho**, a traditional spice that goes well with grilled pork belly, and Natto made in the traditional way. Yuzu Kosho is a spice from the Kyushu region, a natural seasoning made by chopping green yuzu peel, chili peppers, and salt and aging them. It is sometimes used instead of wasabi for sashimi.

You can check out the local prices of Japanese seasonings such as Kewpie mayonnaise, various dressings, Ajinomoto, and curry cubes.

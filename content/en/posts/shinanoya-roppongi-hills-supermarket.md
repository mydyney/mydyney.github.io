If you're looking for special and meaningful Tokyo souvenirs, I recommend Shinanoya supermarket at Roppongi Hills.

It's located at the end of Keyakizaka, where the Roppongi Hills Christmas illumination is in full display, so you can visit without making a special trip.

Shinanoya was established in 1930 in Setagaya as a liquor store and currently operates 4 supermarkets and 12 liquor stores in Tokyo and surrounding areas.

It's known as a "celebrity supermarket" among Tokyoites and is a hot premium supermarket. Upon entering, seasonal flowers welcome you.

The entrance display sells unique regional specialties from across Japan. In autumn, there are many cookies and pies made with chestnuts and sweet potatoes.

There's an amazing variety of prepared meals. When the weather is nice, you can enjoy a bento lunch at Roppongi Hills park. There's a microwave next to the register to heat your food. During lunchtime, it's crowded with office workers buying meals.

## Gift Recommendation 1: Regional Specialty Snacks

This is the regional specialty sweets corner featuring traditional confections made from seasonal ingredients from various regions of Japan. There's everything from gift sets in various packages to individual bag snacks. I bought sweet potato stick snacks from Kyushu, and they had an irresistibly sweet taste.

## Gift Recommendation 2: Sake and Wine

As a supermarket that started as a liquor specialist, there's a diverse selection of Japanese sake, beer, wine, and whisky.

The most famous Japanese sake, Dassai, is available in various types and sizes, making it a perfect gift. The numbers on Dassai indicate the rice polishing ratio, with more polished rice being more expensive (Dassai 23 > Dassai 39 > Dassai 45, 50 in descending order of grade).

</figure>

From March 21, 2025, Korea's duty-free alcohol limit has changed! The bottle quantity restriction has been removed, and the new limit is up to 2L total volume + $400 total value.
※ Alcohol duty-free allowance is separate from the general $800 duty-free limit.

With 180ml small Dassai bottles now tax-free, you can purchase up to 11 bottles duty-free for souvenirs!

If you're curious about the full Dassai lineup's official Japanese prices, check out the article below:

"Junmai Shibanoya" with the Shiba Inu illustration is a good quality-to-price ratio junmai sake produced by Endo Shuzou in Suzaka City, Nagano Prefecture, and is popular as a gift due to its cute design.

Whiskeys collaborated with popular Japanese manga "The Drops of God" and "Attack on Titan" are also visible. Due to their limited edition labels, the prices are... quite high.

The wine section is well-stocked with wines from around the world to Japanese wines. White wine made from Koshu, Japan's native grape variety, pairs well with Japanese seafood dishes.

<figure>
  <img src="/images/posts/shinanoya-roppongi-hills-supermarket-20.jpg" alt="Wine selection">

They also sell Château Mont-Pérat from France's Bordeaux region, which the protagonist in "The Drops of God" tasted while recalling Queen's "Bohemian Rhapsody." It's a good value wine loved in Korea as well.

Currently, Shinanoya Roppongi Hills' #1 best-selling wine is "Villa Golf" from Chile. Villa Golf uses a golf scoring system for its grading (Albatross Gran Reserva > Eagle Reserva > Hole in One > Birdie in descending order). It would make a special and fun souvenir for golf enthusiasts.

</figure>

If you don't drink alcohol, I recommend "Dolce Pop Lemonade."

This beverage uses 10% Sicilian lemon juice from Italy, creating a harmonious blend of lemon freshness and appropriate sweetness. It's good served cold or warmed up, and pairs well with Japanese food.

Take the escalator up to the 2nd floor. The 2nd floor sells fresh foods and processed goods.

  <figcaption>2nd floor fresh produce and groceries area</figcaption>

Vegetables, fruits, meat, fish - there are so many diverse ingredients. Although these are items you can't bring back after international travel, they're fun to browse. The fish section especially is full of seafood and ingredients I'd never seen before.

With one 180ml Dassai bottle from the 1st floor and a sashimi platter, you can create a happy dinner for about ¥2,000 ($13 USD).

## Gift Recommendation 3: Various Seasonings and Sushi Soy Sauce

Japanese cuisine calls "umami" (savory taste) the fifth taste, and they've developed various seasonings to achieve that flavor. Soy sauce, miso, and vinegar differ in color and taste by region, and products are distinguished based on what food they accompany.

<figure>
  <img src="/images/posts/shinanoya-roppongi-hills-supermarket-33.jpg" alt="Soy sauce aisle">
  <figcaption>Wide variety of regional soy sauces</figcaption>
</figure>

There are so many varieties of regionally produced soy sauce. Not only major brands like Kikkoman, Yamasa, and Higashimaru, but also various regional soy sauces - it's fascinating. The Kansai region prefers light-colored soy sauce, while the Kanto region prefers dark-colored soy sauce.

<figure>
  <img src="/images/posts/shinanoya-roppongi-hills-supermarket-34.jpg" alt="Regional soy sauce brands">
  <figcaption>Regional specialty soy sauce brands</figcaption>
</figure>

Among these, I looked for sushi-specific soy sauce. Sushi soy sauce has reduced saltiness compared to regular soy sauce and adds umami and sweetness from kombu and katsuobushi, available in both slightly thin and thick types.

You can purchase traditionally-made Akazu (red vinegar) soy sauce at Shinanoya. Akazu soy sauce uses red vinegar made by aging 100% rice sake lees for 3 years, creating deep flavor and mild acidity, which is why it's used at high-end sushi restaurants. The 150ml size isn't bulky and is reasonably priced, making it a great souvenir.

<figure>
  <img src="/images/posts/shinanoya-roppongi-hills-supermarket-35.jpg" alt="Sushi soy sauce selection">
  <figcaption>Sushi-specific soy sauce varieties</figcaption>
</figure>

There's also Yuzu Kosho, a traditional spice with a spicy taste that pairs well with grilled pork belly, and traditionally-made natto. Yuzu Kosho is a Kyushu regional spice - a natural seasoning made by chopping green yuzu peel, chili peppers, and salt and aging them. It's sometimes used with sashimi instead of wasabi.

Yakisoba, ramen noodles, and Shinanoya roasted coffee beans also make good gifts.

## Gift Recommendation 4: Seasonal Specialty Snacks

In front of the 1st floor register, they sell traditional sweets, breads, and rice cakes made from seasonal ingredients. Autumn features mainly chestnut and sweet potato sweets. They're individually wrapped, making it easy to buy several without burden.

Major Japanese supermarkets often sell merchandise like tote bags and t-shirts with their logos. Payment is accepted in both cash and card, with Korean language support at registers, so there's no difficulty checking out. Staff can communicate in English. After checkout, there's a microwave and hot water pot. Free ice packs are available for fresh food packaging.

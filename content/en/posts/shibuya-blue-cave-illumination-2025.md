## Introduction

Hello! I'm <strong>Tokyo Mate</strong>, a lover of Tokyo's winter nights. ❄️

Today I'm bringing you information about the most mystical illumination in Tokyo: <strong>'2025 Shibuya Blue Cave (青の洞窟 SHIBUYA)'</strong>.

This year marks the 10th anniversary with a giant <strong>'THE SNOWMAN'</strong> balloon! I've thoroughly organized everything from getting there from Shibuya Station without getting lost, to my personally tested <strong>Omotesando connection route</strong>, and the best photo spots.

<strong>💡 Quick Tip: Even if you're busy, just screenshot the 'map' and 'summary table' from this post!</strong>

## Getting There

The Blue Cave Illumination is near Yoyogi Park, accessible from both <strong>Shibuya Station (gentle slope)</strong> and <strong>Harajuku Station (flat route)</strong>, about 10 minutes walk from each.

<figure>
  <img src="/images/posts/shibuya-blue-cave-illumination-2025-04.jpg" alt="Blue illuminated tree-lined street from Shibuya Station through Parco to Blue Cave">
  <figcaption style="font-size: 0.7em; text-align: center;">Blue tree-lined street connecting Shibuya Station past Parco to Blue Cave on Koen-dori</figcaption>
</figure>

### 📍 Recommended Route 1: Walk Along Blue Tree Street from Shibuya Station (10 min walk)

1. Exit from <strong>Shibuya Station Exit A6-3</strong>
2. Walk straight toward <strong>'Shibuya Koen-dori (Park Street)'</strong> where the blue trees begin
3. You'll see <strong>Shibuya PARCO</strong> on your left as you go up the slope
4. Follow the blue tree-lined street up the gentle slope and arrive!

<strong>⚠️ Important!</strong> If you just search "Shibuya Station" on Google Maps, you might get lost in the complex underground maze. Always search for <strong>"Yoyogi Park Zelkova Avenue (代々木公園 ケヤキ並木通り)"</strong> or <strong>"Shibuya PARCO"</strong> as your destination.

### 📍 Recommended Route 2: Connect with Omotesando Illumination (Highly Recommended ⭐)

I really loved starting with the <strong>Omotesando Illumination first, then walking</strong> to the Shibuya Blue Cave near Yoyogi Park (about 10 minutes walk). The contrast of going from the warm <strong>golden tree-lined street</strong> to suddenly <strong>everything turning blue</strong> is overwhelming.

1. Get off at <strong>Omotesando (表参道) Station</strong> and enjoy the illumination walking toward Harajuku
2. Head toward the intersection near Meiji Jingu entrance and Yoyogi Park
3. Walk slowly along the edge of Yoyogi Park, and suddenly the <strong>blue zelkova tree tunnel with branches meeting overhead</strong> unfolds before you

### 📍 Recommended Route 3: Walk from Harajuku Station Along Yoyogi Park

If you want to avoid crowds, I recommend accessing directly from Harajuku/Meiji-jingumae Station.

1. Exit from JR Harajuku Station west exit or Meiji-jingumae Station Exit 2
2. Walk along Yoyogi Park edge for about 10 minutes and you'll find the blue illumination entrance

## Live Scene Sketch & Photo Spot Highlights

As soon as I arrived, I couldn't help but say <strong>"Wow, it really looks like a cave!"</strong> The branches meet overhead and create a feeling of walking through a tunnel completely wrapped in blue light.

### 📸 Photo Spot 1: Walking on Ice (Reflection)

The Blue Cave has a <strong>special reflective mat</strong> on the ground.

- <strong>Photo Tip</strong>: Lower your camera angle as much as possible below knee level!
- The blue lights reflected on the floor give a <strong>feeling of walking on ice</strong>. When I tried it myself, the symmetrical reflection shots came out really beautiful.

### 📸 Photo Spot 2: 2025 New 'THE SNOWMAN'

This year for the anniversary, a <strong>giant snowman balloon</strong> with projected Christmas videos will be installed at Keyaki Avenue plaza. This will be the best main photo spot this year!

### 📸 Photo Spot 3: Shibuya Sky Background

When you look back from the end of the park, you can see the <strong>'Shibuya Scramble Square (Shibuya Sky)'</strong> building in the distance. The blue cave combined with the modern building night view creates an amazingly urban-feeling photo.

## Must-Read Before Visiting! Traveler Survival Tips

Here are the things I wished I knew before going. Don't make the same mistakes! 😉

<strong>1. Dress for 'Deep Winter'!</strong>

Tokyo in December, especially near the park, is quite chilly with lots of wind. If you keep taking your hands out for photos, they'll freeze quickly. Hand warmers are essential in your pockets!

<strong>2. Use Restrooms in Advance</strong>

There are public restrooms in Yoyogi Park, but lines are long and cold. I strongly recommend using facilities in shopping malls like Shibuya PARCO or nearby MODI before heading up.

<strong>3. Golden Time to Avoid Crowds</strong>

For weekdays, I recommend after 20:30. Avoid 18:00~19:00 when commuters and tourists overlap. Going about an hour before closing, you can take solo photos more comfortably.

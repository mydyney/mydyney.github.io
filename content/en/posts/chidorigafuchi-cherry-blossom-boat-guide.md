## 1. The Charm of Chidorigafuchi's Cherry Blossom Ryokudo (Green Way)

<p>The <strong>Ryokudo (Green Way)</strong>, the heart of Chidorigafuchi's cherry blossom scenery, is a space that showcases the very essence of Tokyo's magnificent cherry blossoms — best experienced while rowing through them yourself.</p>

<p>Running alongside the historic Edo Castle moat, this approximately <strong>700-meter walkway</strong> is lined on both sides with roughly <strong>230 Somei Yoshino cherry trees</strong>, Japan's most iconic cherry blossom variety, forming a spectacular cherry blossom tunnel.</p>

<p>The sight of cherry blossom branches drooping low toward the water's surface, almost touching their own reflections, is considered <strong>one of Chidorigafuchi's most photogenic spots</strong>. 📸</p>

### 🌸 Reservations & On-Site Ticketing

<p style="background-color:#fff8b2; padding: 10px; font-weight: bold;">❌ Advance online reservations are not available</p>

<p>Chidorigafuchi boats <strong>do not accept advance reservations.</strong> You must collect a numbered ticket on-site.</p>

<p><strong>1. On-site ticketing only:</strong> During peak congestion, a QR code system may be used supplementarily to check wait status, but the numbered tickets themselves can only be obtained in person.</p>

<p><strong>2. Strategy to minimize wait times:</strong> On weekends and during full bloom, waits can be extremely long. Arriving for the <strong>10:00 AM opening rush</strong> is realistically the only solution.</p>

<p>After getting your numbered ticket, the most efficient plan is to <strong>stroll through Kitanomaru Park</strong> while waiting for your turn.</p>

<p><strong>3. Rules to know (must read):</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Age restriction: Children 15 and under (junior high school and younger) must be accompanied by a guardian.</li>
  <li>Prohibited: Eating, drinking, and alcohol consumption on the boats is prohibited for safety reasons.</li>
  <li>Safety first: Operations may be suspended without notice during strong winds or severe weather.</li>
</ul>

## 3. Chidorigafuchi Night Illumination: Cherry Blossoms After Dark

<p>Chidorigafuchi at dusk reveals an entirely different face from daytime.</p>

<p>Illuminated cherry blossoms reflected on the dark moat waters create a night view that looks like a river of pink light flowing through the city. 🌙</p>

<p>This is why Chidorigafuchi's night scenery is counted among <strong>Tokyo's top 3 night cherry blossom spots</strong>.</p>

### 💡 Light-Up Hours & Important Notes

<ul>
  <li><strong>Illumination hours:</strong> Sunset (approx. 18:00) – 9:00 PM (lights off at exactly 21:00)</li>
</ul>

<p><em>※ Schedule may change or be canceled depending on cherry blossom bloom status and weather conditions.</em></p>

<p><strong>⚠️ Weekend visitors must read (one-way traffic):</strong></p>

<p>During the light-up period, <strong>one-way pedestrian traffic</strong> is enforced on Saturdays and Sundays from 09:00 to 21:00 for crowd management. Entry from the opposite side (Hanzomon Station area) is blocked, so plan your route in advance!</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Kudanshita Station Exit 2 → Enter Chidorigafuchi Ryokudo → Enjoy the illumination</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Hanzomon Station Exit 5 → Entry NOT permitted during weekend light-up hours</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><em>※ Entry from the Hanzomon side is restricted, so be sure to confirm your approach route beforehand.</em></p>

<p>📌 <strong>Tip.</strong> The light-up power comes from solar and renewable energy (E-Cycle Chiyoda), running as an eco-friendly system that offsets carbon emissions.</p>

### 📸 Night Photography Tips & Best Spots

<ul>
  <li><strong>Best spot:</strong> Look for the point where you can capture the cherry blossoms reflected on the water with Tokyo Tower visible in the distance — all in one frame. Rather than near the boat dock entrance, the mid-section of the Ryokudo facing toward Tokyo Tower offers the most impressive composition.</li>
  <li><strong>Golden hour:</strong> Shooting during <strong>magic hour</strong> just after sunset creates a dramatic contrast between the blue sky and pink cherry blossoms, maximizing depth and dimension in your photos.</li>
</ul>

## 4. Recommended Walking Course: Kudanshita Station to Kitanomaru Park

<p>After passing through the crowded Ryokudo area, we recommend this more relaxing and comfortable <strong>healing route</strong>. Kitanomaru Park, connected to the Chidorigafuchi walkway, is a favorite picnic spot among locals. 🌳</p>

### 🚶 Recommended Route (About 20–30 Minutes on Foot)

<p><strong>① Start from Kudanshita Station Exit 2:</strong> Walk along the Ryokudo, taking in the spectacular cherry blossom tunnel stretching approximately 700 meters.</p>

<p><strong>② Check the boat dock:</strong> See the wait situation and grab a numbered ticket first. (If the wait is long, move on to the next step!)</p>

<p><strong>③ Enter Kitanomaru Park (北の丸公園):</strong> At the end of the walkway, cross the bridge and you'll be right at the park entrance.</p>

<p><strong>④ Rest on the lawn:</strong> The park is home to over <strong>200 cherry trees</strong> including Somei Yoshino and Oshima-zakura varieties, with spacious lawns where you can spread out a picnic blanket and relax.</p>

<p>📌 <strong>Tip.</strong> Picnic blankets and alcohol are not allowed on the Chidorigafuchi Ryokudo, but light picnics are permitted in Kitanomaru Park.</p>

<p>During the light-up period, <strong>one-way traffic is enforced on Saturdays and Sundays (09:00–21:00)</strong>. Entry is restricted from the Hanzomon side, so <strong>always enter from the Kudanshita Station direction</strong>!</p>

## 5. Pre-Visit Checklist: Chidorigafuchi Boat & Night View FAQ

<p><strong>Q. Can I store my luggage while using the boats?</strong></p>

<p>A. No, the boat dock does not have luggage storage services or designated storage areas. Use coin lockers at the station, or only bring lightweight items you can carry aboard.</p>

<p><strong>Q. Can I bring my pet on the boat?</strong></p>

<p>A. Pets are allowed only if placed in a hard-shell carrier (hard cage). Soft bags, slings, and similar carriers are not permitted. A pet counts as one adult for passenger capacity purposes.</p>

<p><strong>Q. Are strollers and wheelchairs accessible?</strong></p>

<p>A. Walking the Ryokudo is possible, but the boat dock does not have elevators or accessible boarding facilities. Staff assistance is needed for stairs, and support may be limited during peak festival crowds.</p>

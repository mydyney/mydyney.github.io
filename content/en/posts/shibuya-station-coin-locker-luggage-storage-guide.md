"Where are the empty coin lockers?!" 😱
"I can't find a place for my large suitcase!"

If you're visiting Shibuya, you've probably faced the **"Luggage Storage Crisis"** at least once. With the complex "Shibuya Dungeon" station structure and endless crowds, finding an empty locker is harder than finding a hidden gem restaurant.

But don't worry! As a Tokyo local, I've compiled the **ultimate guide to Shibuya luggage storage** to save you from wandering around with heavy bags. From secret locker spots to apps that guarantee a spot, here is everything you need to know!

## 1. Finding Coin Lockers in Shibuya Station (Difficulty: ⭐⭐⭐⭐)

First, let's look at the coin lockers within JR and Metro Shibuya Station.

**⚠️ Warning:** Most convenient locations (near Hachiko Gate) are **almost always full** from the morning. If you see an empty spot, grab it immediately!

### 🔑 Key Tips for Coin Lockers
*   **Payment:** Most accept **IC Cards (Suica/Pasmo)** and cash (100 yen coins).
*   **Prices:** Small (400-500 yen) / Medium (600-700 yen) / Large (800-1000 yen).
*   **Time Limit:** Usually up to 3 days (charges apply every 24 hours, often resetting at midnight/2AM).

## 6. Tips for Night Owls & Early Birds (24H Storage) 🌙

Late-night flight or early morning bus? **Avoid station coin lockers!**
Most station areas close their shutters after the last train (around 12:30 AM), meaning **you won't be able to retrieve your bag until morning**.

**✅ 24-Hour Solutions:**
1.  **Use Bounce App:** Book a 24-hour Karaoke (like Big Echo) or Manga Cafe.
2.  **Mega Don Quijote:** Has lockers for shoppers, but they are extremely competitive.
3.  **Caution:** Street lockers are open 24/7 but can be less secure. Stick to manned facilities via apps if possible.

## 🙋‍♀️ FAQ

**Q. Can I bring large luggage to Shibuya Sky?**

**Q. How long can I leave luggage in a coin locker?**
A. Usually up to **3 days (72 hours)**. Fees are added every 24 hours (usually past midnight or 2 AM). For long-term storage, **ecbo cloak** is safer and often cheaper.

"Where are the empty coin lockers?!" 😱
"I can't find a place for my large suitcase!"

If you're visiting Shibuya, you've probably faced the <strong>"Luggage Storage Crisis"</strong> at least once. With the complex "Shibuya Dungeon" station structure and endless crowds, finding an empty locker is harder than finding a hidden gem restaurant.

But don't worry! As a Tokyo local, I've compiled the <strong>ultimate guide to Shibuya luggage storage</strong> to save you from wandering around with heavy bags. From secret locker spots to apps that guarantee a spot, here is everything you need to know!

## 1. Finding Coin Lockers in Shibuya Station (Difficulty: ⭐⭐⭐⭐)

First, let's look at the coin lockers within JR and Metro Shibuya Station.

<strong>⚠️ Warning:</strong> Most convenient locations (near Hachiko Gate) are <strong>almost always full</strong> from the morning. If you see an empty spot, grab it immediately!

### 🔑 Key Tips for Coin Lockers
*   <strong>Payment:</strong> Most accept <strong>IC Cards (Suica/Pasmo)</strong> and cash (100 yen coins).
*   <strong>Prices:</strong> Small (400-500 yen) / Medium (600-700 yen) / Large (800-1000 yen).
*   <strong>Time Limit:</strong> Usually up to 3 days (charges apply every 24 hours, often resetting at midnight/2AM).

## 6. Tips for Night Owls & Early Birds (24H Storage) 🌙

Late-night flight or early morning bus? <strong>Avoid station coin lockers!</strong>
Most station areas close their shutters after the last train (around 12:30 AM), meaning <strong>you won't be able to retrieve your bag until morning</strong>.

<strong>✅ 24-Hour Solutions:</strong>
1.  <strong>Use Bounce App:</strong> Book a 24-hour Karaoke (like Big Echo) or Manga Cafe.
2.  <strong>Mega Don Quijote:</strong> Has lockers for shoppers, but they are extremely competitive.
3.  <strong>Caution:</strong> Street lockers are open 24/7 but can be less secure. Stick to manned facilities via apps if possible.

## 🙋‍♀️ FAQ

<strong>Q. Can I bring large luggage to Shibuya Sky?</strong>

<strong>Q. How long can I leave luggage in a coin locker?</strong>
A. Usually up to <strong>3 days (72 hours)</strong>. Fees are added every 24 hours (usually past midnight or 2 AM). For long-term storage, <strong>ecbo cloak</strong> is safer and often cheaper.

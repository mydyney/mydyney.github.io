<h2 id="part-1-tokyo-3-major-soba-schools">Part 1. Know Before You Eat! Tokyo's 3 Major Soba Schools</h2>

Tokyo soba has three roots (schools). First, we'll introduce the representative establishments that best showcase each school's characteristics.

### 1️⃣ [Yabu] Salty Edo Flavor: Namiki Yabu Soba (並木藪蕎麦)

"The tsuyu is this strong?" You might be surprised at first. The salty, rich tsuyu was made for hardworking Edo laborers who sweated all day. Just dip the tip of the noodles lightly. A must-visit course after sightseeing at Asakusa's Kaminarimon.

- **Recommended Menu:** Zaru Soba (ざるそば), Kamo Nanban (鴨南蛮 / Duck hot soba)
- **🚃 Location: Asakusa Station (3-minute walk)**
- **⚠️ Note: Cash only (no cards)**
- 📍**[View on Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/owVA4TVnVQihGEfW9)**

### 2️⃣ [Sunaba] The Longest History: Muromachi Sunaba (室町砂場)

Starting in Osaka and settling in Tokyo, this establishment boasts the longest history. The tsuyu is less salty than Yabu and well-balanced, making it a flavor that everyone, young and old, can enjoy. The serene atmosphere nestled in Nihonbashi's forest of buildings is exquisite.

- **Recommended Menu:** Tenzaru / Tenmori (天ざる / Tempura soba original), Nanban Mori (南ばんもり)
- **🚃 Location: Shin-Nihonbashi Station**
- 📍**[View on Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ZJHMuDbdorzPFpW57)**

### 3️⃣ [Sarashina] White and Refined Aristocratic Taste: Sarashina Horii Honten (更科堀井 本店)

Using only the completely peeled inner part of buckwheat, the noodles are white and fine like somen. The subtle sweetness and smooth texture are sophisticated.

- **Recommended Menu:** Sarashina Soba (さらしなそば), Kakiage Tenmori (かき揚げ天もり)
- **🚃 Location: Azabu-Juban Station**
- 📍**[View on Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/hD7kf2F4aqwFsVgC7)**
- ➡️**[Sarashina Horii Honten, Tokyo's 3 Major Soba, Tokyo Roppongi Soba Restaurant](https://blog.naver.com/tokyomate/223666751487)**

<h2 id="part-2-tabelog-hyakumeiten">Part 2. Gourmet Paradise: Tabelog Hyakumeiten BEST 3</h2>

If the 3 major soba schools represent tradition, these places are **"the hottest and most delicious spots in Tokyo right now."** We've carefully selected 3 must-visit places for travelers from the Hyakumeiten list.

### 👑 1. Tokyo Soba's Living Textbook: Kanda Matsuya (神田まつや)

Transcending the 3 major schools, this place is called **Edo soba culture itself**. The taste of soba eaten in a nearly 100-year-old cultural heritage-level wooden building, sharing tables with strangers, gives you a feeling of time-slipping. It's also famous as a place loved by author Ikenami Shōtarō and has the most developed culture of pre-meal sake (sobamae).

- **Recommended:** Tennuki (天抜き) + Atsukan (hot sake), Mori Soba
- **Business Hours (12/31): 10:00 ~ 21:30 (※ Caution: Early closing if ingredients run out)**
- **Location:** Ogawamachi Station (walking distance from Akihabara)
- **⚠️ Must Check:** Cash only (no cards/QR)
- 📍**[View on Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ewL8vW8VGCcPgziJ8)**

### ⭐️ 2. Michelin-Recognized Aroma: Tamawarai (玉笑)

If you want sophistication different from traditional soba restaurants, this is the place. Awarded Michelin 1-star, the aroma of buckwheat managed directly from the field is overwhelming. Even chewing the noodles without tsuyu, the nutty flavor explodes. Located between Harajuku and Omotesando, it's perfect to visit before or after shopping.

- **Recommended Menu:** Arabiki Seiro (粗挽きせいろ), Atsumori Seiro (熱もりせいろ / Warm noodles)
- **Location:** Meiji-Jingumae Station
- **⚠️ Must Check:** Cash only, No entry for elementary school children and younger
- 📍**[View on Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Zt4Xdz8E261PVe1P6)**

### 🍤 3. Perfect Harmony of Tempura and Soba: Kyorakutei (石臼挽き手打 蕎楽亭)

Highly recommended for those thinking "Soba alone is a bit plain." Selected for Michelin Bib Gourmand, the **tempura** here is as artistic as the soba. The crispy conger eel tempura fried right in front of you paired with soba is truly heavenly. Located in Kagurazaka, called "Tokyo's little Paris," it's perfect for a date course.

- **Recommended Menu:** Tenzaru (天ざる), Mugimeoto (むぎめおと / Half soba, half udon)
- **Location:** Ushigome-Kagurazaka Station
- **⚠️ Must Check:** Cash only, Write your name in the notebook for waiting
- 📍**[View on Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/EjxSgxjNNERo3xFx8)**

<h2 id="survival-tips">3 Survival Tips for the December 31st Soba War</h2>

1. **🕓 Lunch Attack is the Answer:** December 31st is the busiest day of the year. Many places close at 3-4 PM when ingredients run out, so aim for **late lunch** rather than dinner.
2. **💸 Cash Required:** Except for 'Sarashina Horii' and 'Muromachi Sunaba,' most places don't accept cards. Bring plenty of cash when visiting traditional establishments.
3. **🔥 Prepare for Waiting:** 1-2 hour waits are standard. Hand warmers and warm clothing are essential.

Whether you choose the traditional taste of Part 1's 3 major soba restaurants or the special gourmet experience of Part 2's Hyakumeiten spots, a bowl of soba eaten in Tokyo on the last day of 2025 will become an unforgettable memory.

Happy New Year! (Yoi otoshi o! 良いお年を!) 🙇🏻‍♀️

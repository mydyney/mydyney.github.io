## 3️⃣ Best Viewing Spots (Winners & Non-Winners)

We reveal **viewing points around the government building** for both ticket winners and those who unfortunately didn't win.

### 🎫 [Winners] Tomin Plaza (Main Area)

- **Best Spot:** Obviously the front of the stage. All standing, so lines form before entry starts (21:30).
- **Tip:** To secure a front seat, arrive early with complete **cold weather gear (hot packs, padding)** and wait.

### 📷 [Non-Winners] Hidden Gems (Target the East Side!)

Even without a ticket, you can still enjoy the **giant projection mapping** projected on the government building exterior from surrounding streets. These are popular hidden countdown spots for travelers.

**① Shinjuku Sumitomo Building & Triangle Plaza Area**

Viewing position from the side (northeast) of the government building. Few obstructions and a preferred hidden gem for photographers to capture the majestic height of the government building at a glance.

**📍** <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/CemTteSF27CeDR629" target="_blank"><strong>Google Maps↗</strong></a>

**② Keio Plaza Hotel Front Street**

Where the east wall of Government Building No. 1 looks most 'frontal'. You have to look up, but great for feeling the visual beauty.

**📍** <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/Q74ETAUxarHfgRvt6" target="_blank"><strong>Google Maps↗</strong></a>

**③ Shinjuku NS Building Front Overpass**

View of the government building from the southeast. Being on an overpass gives an open view, advantageous for taking commemorative photos with people.

## 4️⃣ Viewing Day Checklist (Q&A)

**Q. Until when do trains run on December 31st?**

A. Major Tokyo trains (JR, Tokyo Metro, etc.) operate **all-night service** from the night of December 31st through the morning of January 1st. No worry about not being able to get home, but intervals are longer than usual, so travel with time to spare.

**Q. Is it very cold?**

A. Yes, it's cold! The area around the government building has strong wind (building wind) blowing between high-rise buildings. **Long padding, hot packs, gloves** are essential. You'll be standing outdoors for over 2 hours.

**Q. What if I lose the lottery?**

A. Don't be too disappointed! While you can't enter the main plaza, you can still fully feel the festival atmosphere on the **Shinjuku Neon Walk** streets around the government building.

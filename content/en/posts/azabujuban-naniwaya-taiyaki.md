## ✨ 100-Year Legacy: Naniwaya Sohonten, Tokyo's Top 3 Taiyaki

Established in 1909 (Meiji 42), **Naniwaya Sohonten** is a symbol of Azabujuban. Along with Wakaba in Yotsuya and Yanagiya in Ningyocho, it's considered one of **Tokyo's Top 3 Taiyaki** shops.

Their signature taiyaki features sweet bean paste (anko) slow-cooked for 8 hours, packed generously into thin, crispy skin—filled all the way to the tail. When you bite into it, the satisfying crunch and sweet bean flavor instantly fill your mouth.

## 🐟 Not Just Taiyaki? (Menu & Tips)

### 1st Floor: Taiyaki Takeout (Cash Required!)

The 1st floor is dedicated to taiyaki takeout. Watching the artisans hand-craft each taiyaki using traditional methods is part of the experience.

**Payment is CASH ONLY.** Credit cards, electronic payments, and QR codes are not accepted. Make sure to bring cash before your visit!

**📌 Pro Tip:** If your taiyaki gets cold, reheat it briefly in an oven or toaster to restore its crispy texture.

### 2nd Floor: Naniwaya Café

The 2nd floor houses a cozy 12-seat café where you can enjoy freshly grilled taiyaki and other local favorites:

- **Hidden Gem: Yakisoba** - Old-fashioned stir-fried noodles that are extremely popular among regulars.
- **Summer Special: Kakigori (Shaved Ice)** - During summer, try the "Uji Kintoki" (matcha red bean shaved ice) while watching taiyaki being grilled over hot flames in the non-air-conditioned 2nd floor—a truly unique experience!

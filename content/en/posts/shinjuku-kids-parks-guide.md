## Is Shinjuku Just for Adults?

Shinjuku may seem like a grown-up city, but if you've chosen Shinjuku for your accommodation, you can absolutely center your family trip with kids here too.

There are exactly three reasons why Shinjuku is the best base camp for family travelers with children:

**Busta Shinjuku (Bus Terminal), Keio Line & JR Line Transfer Hub, JR Limited Express Fuji Kaiyū (富士回遊)**

These three transportation hubs all converge in one place.

With this one guide, you can design **children, elementary students, and family courses** among Tokyo Shinjuku attractions **all from Shinjuku Station at once**.

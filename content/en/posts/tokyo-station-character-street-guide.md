<strong>💡 Tokyo Mate Tip</strong>

If you're on the 1st floor (ground level), use the <strong>Yaesu Passage</strong> or find <strong>Daimaru Department Store</strong>. Use the stairs going down to the basement right next to the department store to connect directly to Character Street.

<strong>👀 Wait! Need a sugar boost before shopping?</strong>

Right across from the Character Street entrance (facing the ticket gate) is <strong>'Okashi Land'</strong> selling freshly fried Jagariko and warm Tokyo Banana curry bread. How about starting with a snack for shopping stamina?

Tokyo Station Character Street is a magical place where 1-2 hours 'disappear' just browsing. After shopping and getting bags full in both hands, store them in coin lockers and how about a hot bowl of ramen at the nearby <strong>Tokyo Ramen Street</strong>? 🍜 If you want light freshly fried fries or dessert, we recommend <strong>Okashi Land</strong> across the way!

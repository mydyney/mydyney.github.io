​

When you arrive at Tokyo Station, there are dozens of exits and it's confusing, right? Just remember one thing.

<b>"Yaesu Underground Central Exit"</b>

​

<ol>
<li>After getting off the train, follow the yellow signs toward <b>'Yaesu'</b>.</li>
<li>Find and exit through the <b>Yaesu Underground Central ticket gate</b>.</li>
<li>Right after exiting the ticket gate, you'll see the colorful <b>'Tokyo Character Street'</b> sign straight ahead. (10-second walk!)</li>
</ol>

</figure>

​

<b>💡 Tokyo Mate Tip</b>

If you're on the 1st floor (ground level), use the <b>Yaesu Passage</b> or find <b>Daimaru Department Store</b>. Use the stairs going down to the basement right next to the department store to connect directly to Character Street.

​

<b>👀 Wait! Need a sugar boost before shopping?</b>

Right across from the Character Street entrance (facing the ticket gate) is <b>'Okashi Land'</b> selling freshly fried Jagariko and warm Tokyo Banana curry bread. How about starting with a snack for shopping stamina?

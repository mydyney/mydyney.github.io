  <li><strong>Expected full bloom (Somei Yoshino):</strong> Late March ~ Early April</li>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Closed:</strong> Every Monday (except during the special opening period from March 25 – April 24, when it's open daily)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>📌 Key Point:</strong> Unlike Chidorigafuchi's tunnel-style cherry blossoms, Shinjuku Gyoen is an open-field viewing spot where you can relax on spacious lawns. As a large urban garden, its wide variety of species means the <strong>viewing period is exceptionally long</strong>.</p>

## 2. 2026 Cherry Blossom Season Advance Reservation Guide

<p>To manage crowds during cherry blossom season, Shinjuku Gyoen requires <strong>advance reservations on weekends and holidays in March–April</strong>. Don't risk being turned away — check the details below!</p>

### 📅 2026 Advance Reservation Schedule

<ul>
  <li><strong>Reservations open:</strong> <strong>Early March 2026</strong> (expected)</li>
  <li><strong>Reservation dates:</strong> March 21 (Sat), 22 (Sun), 28 (Sat), 29 (Sun), April 4 (Sat), 5 (Sun) (expected)</li>

### 🖱️ Online Reservation Method (Ticket Options)

<p>On the reservation site (Asoview), you'll need to choose the right ticket for your situation.</p>
<p><a href="https://shinjukugyoen.hp.peraichi.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" style="color: #667eea; text-decoration: underline;"><strong>👉 Official Shinjuku Gyoen Online Reservation</strong></a></p>

<p><strong>1️⃣ Date-Specific E-Ticket (Includes Admission) 👍 Recommended</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>For:</strong> Regular adults (most visitors)</li>
  <li><strong>What it is:</strong> Pay the <strong>admission fee (¥500) in advance</strong> at the time of reservation.</li>
  <li><strong>Advantage:</strong> No need to line up at the ticket booth at all! Just scan the <strong>QR code on your smartphone and walk right in</strong> — the fastest way to enter.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>2️⃣ Date-Specific Advance Reservation (Pay On-Site)</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>For:</strong> Discount-eligible visitors (seniors 65+, students with ID), those who prefer paying on-site with cash, etc.</li>

## 3. Shinjuku Gyoen Ticket Purchase Methods (Skip-the-Line Tips)

<p>On non-reservation days or when you need to pay on-site, the two fastest methods are below. <strong>Ticket booth lines during cherry blossom season easily exceed 30 minutes</strong>, so make sure to use these options!</p>

### 💰 Shinjuku Gyoen Admission Fees

<ul>
  <li><strong>Adults (General):</strong> ¥500</li>
  <li><strong>Seniors 65+ / Students (high school and above):</strong> ¥250 (ID required)</li>
  <li><strong>Junior high school and younger:</strong> Free</li>
</ul>

  <figcaption style="font-size: 0.7em; text-align: center;">Shinjuku Gyoen admission fee sign — ¥500 for adults</figcaption>
</figure>

<p><strong>① Method 1: [Highly Recommended] Official E-Ticket QR Entry</strong></p>
<p>If you've already paid during the reservation stage, skip the ticket booth entirely — just scan your smartphone QR code and walk right in.</p>

<p><strong>② Method 2: IC Card (Suica/PASMO) Touch & Go</strong></p>
<p>Didn't get a reservation, or visiting on a non-reservation day? Don't stand in the ticket booth line! There's a dedicated lane where you can tap your IC card at the gate and enter immediately. Not knowing about this costs you at least 20 minutes. 🚀</p>

## 4. Cherry Blossom Season Entrance Strategy & Starbucks Tips

### 🚶‍♂️ Entrance Strategy: Save 30 Minutes by Choosing the Right Gate

<ul>
  <li><strong>Shinjuku Gate (新宿門):</strong> The main entrance with the longest lines. At peak times, just getting in can take dozens of minutes.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Okido Gate (大木戸門) & Sendagaya Gate (千駄ヶ谷門):</strong> Much less crowded, and closer to the Starbucks and greenhouse — strategically the best choice.</li>
</ul>

</figure>

### ☕ Starbucks Best Spot & Tips (Closes at 4PM!)

<p>The Starbucks inside Shinjuku Gyoen was the first private business to open inside a national park in Japan. But during cherry blossom season, the indoor seating competition is fierce. (Hours: 09:00 – 16:00)</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Best spot strategy:</strong> Don't fight for a seat inside! Get your drink to go and head to the <strong>English Landscape Garden</strong> — spread a picnic mat under the cherry blossoms. That's the real way to enjoy the <strong>Shinjuku Gyoen Starbucks experience</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><strong>⚠️ Early closing warning:</strong> According to official information, orders may be cut off early during peak congestion, and the store closes at <strong>4:00 PM</strong> — so try to visit in the morning.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Mobile Order tip:</strong> Place a <strong>Mobile Order</strong> via the Starbucks app right after entering the park. By the time you walk to the store (about 10–15 minutes), your drink will be ready — saving you significant wait time.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>☕ This location uses special location pricing (Category B), so prices may be slightly higher than regular stores.</em></p>

<p>Shinjuku Gyoen was once an imperial garden, and its rules are stricter than your typical park. To enjoy your picnic without any issues, make sure to check the <strong>prohibited items</strong> below!</p>

When it comes to choosing accommodation in Tokyo, success depends on two factors: **location** and **transportation**. And at the heart of it all is always **Shinjuku**.

However, Shinjuku Station is the most complex station in Japan (nicknamed the "Shinjuku Dungeon" 😱), so **if you choose the wrong hotel location, your walking time doubles every time you travel**.

"Is there a hotel with direct airport access?"
"I want to travel affordably using subway passes..."
"Where can a family of 4 stay in one room?"

Today, Tokyo Mate—your daily Tokyo guide—has analyzed search volume, reviews, ratings, and accessibility data to carefully select **10 recommended Shinjuku hotels**.

## How to Get to Tokyo Ramen Street

Tokyo Ramen Street is located on the B1 floor of Tokyo Station building.

While Tokyo Station seems complex, the B1 floor structure is simple. Character Street to Ramen Street extends along a long corridor.

Ramen Street is in the orange section of the map, on the opposite end from Character Street (blue section). Walk to the end opposite Character Street to find it.

<strong>👀 Wait! Not visiting 'Character Street' on the opposite end?</strong>

After eating ramen, if you walk to the opposite end to digest, you'll find over 30 character shops including <strong>Chiikawa, Pokemon, and Crayon Shin-chan</strong>. Check the relocated shop locations on the 1st floor and integrated tax-free tips before you go!

I visited on a weekday at 2 PM and waited about 30 minutes. They guide you to purchase meal tickets in order while waiting. Cash only. Prices vary by noodle portion size.

The regular size Special Tsukemen is 1,150 yen. After eating about half, I added the chili pepper seasoning on the table and it became even more delicious with the spicy kick.

### Taste Tokyo in a Bowl of Ramen

Tokyo Ramen Street is filled with ramen of various flavors and personalities.

Wait times can be long, so I recommend visiting at opening time or during weekday afternoon hours.

Most shops are cash-only, so be sure to bring cash!

### 🍦 Dessert at 'Okashi Land' After Ramen!

After eating salty ramen, you'll naturally crave something sweet. Right next to Ramen Street, <strong>'Okashi Land'</strong> offers freshly fried Jagariko and soft serve ice cream for the perfect sweet-and-salty course! 👇

### 💡 Gave Up Due to Long Wait?

During lunch/dinner peak times, Ramen Street wait times can exceed 1 hour. If you're hungry but your train time is approaching, getting a high-quality bento from the nearby 'Ekiben-ya Matsuri' for takeout is also an excellent option.

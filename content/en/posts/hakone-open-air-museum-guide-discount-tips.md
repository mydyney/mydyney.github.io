## 🌳 What is the Hakone Open-Air Museum?

Opened in 1969, the <strong>Hakone Open-Air Museum</strong> is Japan's first outdoor art museum. Spreading over 70,000 square meters of lush greenery with views of the magnificent Hakone mountains, about 120 masterpieces by representative modern and contemporary sculptors are on permanent display. It is a special space where you can experience artworks that change their expression according to the time and season, as if taking a stroll with no fixed path.

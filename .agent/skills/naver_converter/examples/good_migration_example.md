<strong>☀️ What to Do During the Day?</strong>
Before the market opens, we recommend visiting the massive temple <strong>'Zojoji (増上寺)'</strong> right next door to enjoy the special scenery of the traditional temple harmonizing with Tokyo Tower. If you have time, consider going up <strong>'Tokyo Tower'</strong> itself to enjoy Tokyo's panoramic view, then coming down to the market in the evening—a perfect day course.
